# Version History

> In this document all references to config file **ScrnBalance.ini** should be
  treated as **ScrnBalanceSrv.ini**, if you're using server version of
  ScrnBalance (ScrnBalanceSrv.ScrnBalance).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## VERSION 9

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## v9.72.14
- **FTGSO v2.02**: adjusted dialogues; dead players spawn at the trader.
- Fixed an issue where Combat Medic received a discount on MAC10.
- Healing messages moved back to the middle.
- Removed duplicate healing messages.

## v9.72.12
### Follow The Guardian: Special Ops (FTGSO)
- A new game mode by [nmmblez] that allows to play the Story Mode on regular survival maps.
- FTGSO takes place the next day after the KFO-Transit fight. Kevin 'Patriarch' Clamely didn't escape to Paris, and the remaining members of the DRF squads returned to the UK, searching for him.
- FTGSO is a prequel to **Follow The Guardian: On The Clock**.
### Game Modes
- New game mode - **54. Follow The Guardian: Special Ops**
- "04. ScrN Zeds Medium" and "52. Escape the Hunter" removed from the official rotation. You can still restore them via *KFMapVote.ini*.
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: added `TraderDialogues`, `CombatDialogues`, and `FtgDialogues` for story-telling.
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: added `RULE_Dialogue`.
- Adjusted ammo box spawn for `RULE_GrabAmmo` waves.
- Players are spawned separately if possible when `bStartAtTrader=true` and `bOpenTrader=false`. Previously, they were spawned near random traders, and it was possible for 5 players to spawn together while the last one was split from the team. Now all players are split if the map has enough shops.
- Fixed an issue when `bMoreAmmoBoxes=true` was forced for all waves with `bOpenTrader=false`, not only `RULE_GrabAmmo`.
- `TraderMessage` overrides the default "The shop is now open for business!" message instead of showing both (thanks [nmmblez])
### Burning Performance Optimization
- Significantly improved rendering performance of different flames (Flamethrower, Husk Gun, burning zeds, etc.)
- Fire projectiles and burning zeds do not cast dynamic light if World Detail is set to Low, or the framerate is below `MinDesiredFrameRate` (*KillingFloor.ini*)
- Reduced the number of dynamic lights for World Detail = Normal.
- World Detail = High has also been optimized, but without sacrificing visual fidelity.
- Burning Zed optimization currently applies to ScrN Weapon Pak only.
### Follow The Guardian
- Players outside the base receive the "Get back to the base" warning even when others are still at the base.
- `MVOTE END WAVE` is allowed now.
- Last zeds in the wave get marked as in the regular survival.
- Fixed missing "GO TO TRADER" text on the HUD durint `RULE_ReachTrader`
- Wave Header/Title/Message is displayed in blue to match the HUD theme.
- The "BASE SETUP" hint is not displayed if the wave has no Guardian (`FtgRule=FTG_NoBase`)
### Weapon Balance
- **Trenchgun** weight lowered 6 => 5kg, allowing it to be carried alongside a Flamethrower or a Husk Gun.
- **MAC10** is a crossperk weapon for Firebug and **Combat Medic**. The latter has no incendiary mags but has bigger magazines and impact damage bonus.
- **HK417** weight raised 7 => 8kg to prevent carrying it alongside an FN FAL, unless sacrificing armor.
- **HK417** damage lowered 80 => 75 (Lv6: 128 => 120) to prevent one-body-shot killing Crawlers.
- **HK417** headshot multiplier increased x1.75 => x2.0 to compensate for its damage and weight nerfs.
- **VSS Vintorez** can always switch fire modes.
### Other Changes
- `MVOTE SKIP` a single command to invote BORING, END WAVE, or END TRADE depending on the current phase. Added to ScrN key binding. Old commands still work.
- **Patriarch** can be marked (pinged) while visible.
- Healed players receive the message telling who has healed them (thanks *resonant*)
- *ScrnUser.ini*: added `bHealMessages` and `bHealedByMessages`
- *ScrnMapInfo.ini*: Added map definition for **KF-Oakview**
- **LAR** is no longer considered a "pistol" despite being a Gunslinger's perked weapon.
- An ammo box cannot respawn for 30 seconds after being picked up. That should discourage players from camping near ammo boxes waiting for them to respawn in `RULE_GrabAmmo` waves.
- The minimum ammo respawn cooldown is proportionally lowered for maps with fewer than 10 ammo boxes.
- Fixed **Flamethrower** bug where it continued firing after a nade throw, ignoring the fire trigger's release.
- (Probably) Fixed a bug where a scoped weapon could get stuck at the aiming animation after weapon switching.
- Yet another gun recoil fix during Zed Time.
## ScrN Weapon Pack
- Burning Zed performance optimization
- **Brute** base health lowered 1000 => 990 to stop considering him a big zed.
## Horzine Technician
- Fixed **Cryo Thrower** bug where it continued firing after a nade throw, ignoring the fire trigger's release.


## v9.72.10
- Fixed a bug where Sudden Death was enabled on the boss wave in FTG

## v9.72.09
- Fixed Counter calculation for `RULE_ReachTrader`

## v9.72.08
### New Survival
- A new game mode inspired by New Doom but without Doom monsters.
- When all the zeds in a wave are spawned, players need to push through them to the trader.
- Zeds keep spawning until all players reach the trader or die.

### New Doom v6.66
- The "Trader Path" waves require reaching the trader instead of timeout (like in New Survival)
- Removed `Doom3Mutator` as being redundant.
- **Cherub** health lowered 150 => 110 (HoE 262 => 192)
- **Imp** health lowered 320 => 200 (HoE 560 => 350)
- **Revenant** may shoot only one rocket at a time when not raged.
- **Revenant** explosive damage resistance lowered 50% => 20%
- **Revenant** projectiles slowed down by 20%

### Other Changes
- Fixed the point-blank headshot detection bug with medic grenades (**M79M**, **M203M**)
- Added objective descriptions to the HUD for waves that require doing something else besides killing zeds (reach trader, earn dosh, gram ammo, etc.)
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: Setting `Header` or `Title` to "-" clears them (does not display on the HUD and Scoreboard).
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: new EndRule - `RULE_ReachTrader`
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: new config options: `Timelimit` and `NoBountyTimeout`
- **FTG**: Stinky Clot now can be killed by movers (thanks [nmmblez])
- Fixed glowing skins of custom characters (thanks [That1Guy])
- Fixed an issue where `RULE_GrabAmmo` counted ammo from the previous wave if `bOpenTrader=false` (thanks [nmmblez])
- **72. Mystery Game v2.10**: switched to `RULE_ReachTrader` for trader path waves.

### ScrN Weapon Pack
- Added the "AP" prefix to **Hunting Rifle** to indicate that it is good against Fleshpounds.

## v9.72.05
- Fixed an issue when mid-wave reconnected players could respawn with a wrong perk.

## v9.72.04
- Added a 5-second delay before mid-wave respawning a reconnected player.
- Removed the **Machete** weapon priority boost if Machete-sprinting is disabled.

## v9.72.03
- Added a workaround for misconfigured MusicTrigger to play music
- Fixed an issue when payer paths still could go via `ZombiePathNode`
- *ScrnMapInfo.ini*: added `DebugShop` and `DebugZVol`
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: `CustomPerks` now can be used to override the original perks

## v9.72.02
- **FTG**: Fixed `FtgRule` in the boss wave

## v9.72.01
### Mid-Wave Respawn
- Allows crashed or disconnected players to reconnect and respawn mid-wave.

- Only those who were alive while disconnected are allowed to respawn mid-wave.
- Mid-wave respawned players restore their previous health, armor, and weapons.
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: added `bMidWaveRespawnReconnetedPlayers`, `bPauseOnDisconnect`, `PauseTimeOnDisconnect`, and `ResumeDelayOnReconnect`.

### Other Changes
- *ScrnGames.ini*: fixed an issue with the boss wave when `bUniqueWaves=true`
- *ScrnMapInfo.ini*: Added map definition for **KF-Chthon-SE**
- *ScrnMapInfo.ini*: Setting `bDebug=True` spawns all weapons and ammo on the map (for placement testing)
- *ScrnMapInfo.ini*: Fixed `Door` in `ZVolLinks`
- **FTG:OTC v2.53**: Re-enabled Stinky respawn on TP waves

## v9.72
- The default map voting handler switched to `KFMapVoteV3SE.KFVotingHandler`
- Deprecated `VotingHandlerOverride`
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: added `[ScrnBalanceSrv.ScrnInit]` section to override the map voting handler.
- *KFMapVote.ini*: switched to `[KFMapVoteV3SE.KFVotingHandler]`
- New game mode - **53. Follow or Escape**, where the players need to either Follow The Guardian or Escape The Hunter.
- *ScrnGames.ini*: Added random wave dependency, where a random wave is followed a specific wave (e.g., `Wave2A => Wave3A | Wave2B => Wave3B`).
- **52. Escape The Hunter v1.03** - added the Hunter to the boss wave. Players need to kill Pat while escaping the Hunter.
- **XCM**: a player can get the "Suicide Bomber" achievement by killing 10 zeds with the "ass pipe" explosion
- Player paths avoid `ZombiePathNode` (path to the trader or base)
- Chat spam prevention switched to "5 messages per 10 seconds" instead of "1 message per 2 seconds"

## v9.71.17
- **FTG**: `StinkyClot` extends `ZombieClotMix`. The latter is an unused legacy zed that can be referenced on maps to block Stinky Clot path (e.g., `ZombiePathNode.DisallowedZombies`)

## v9.71.16
- ZombieVolumes within 90uu of Z distance from the player is considered on the same floor (no FloorPenalty applied)

### ScrN Zed Pack
- Fixed an issue where decapitated zed chunks may never disapper client-side

## v9.71.15
- Fixed headshot detection of wide melee swings.
- Melee weapons now properly play flesh hit sounds on dedicated servers (thanks [Broski])
- Fixed custom gun skins for spawn weapons (thanks[Duckbuster] and [That1Guy])
- Last 16 zeds in a wave spawn closer to players with forced **FastTrack**
- **FTG**: Tweaked the ammo production rate to approximately one box per player per minute.
- Stinky Clot doesn't produce additional ammo boxes if a lot of ammo is produced shortly. It prevents an overwhelming amount of ammo on maps with many ammo boxes.
- Stinky Clot may produce additional ammo boxes even in the Solo game if he hasn't spawned them for a while.
- Fixed `ZVolLinks` in *ScrnMapInfo.ini*
- *ScrnMapInfo.ini*: added `AchName` to override map achievement for a custom map/version
- *ScrnMapInfo.ini*: added map definition for the upcomming **KF-BioticsLab-SE**
- **TSC**: allowed L4D character selection. L4D1 survivors can be picked on the red team, L4D2 - blue.
- **Berserker** range weapon movement penalty reduced to -10% (from -15%).
- **Speed Boost**: Player base movement speed reduced to 250 (down from 260). Now, players have +25% speed over the regular game, like zeds.
- `DebugClear` console command - clear debug lines from the screen (e.g., clear zed spawn cylinders when bDebug=true)

### ScrN Zed Pack
- Fixed **Brute**'s pushing force to properly include the target's mass. Heavy zeds are harder to push.

## v9.71.12
- **TSC**: fixed a bug where doors respawned at the beginning of a wave instead of trader time.
- Adjusted **TSC** message position to avoid overlaps with player death messages.

#### Heavy Machinegunner
- **M41A** 3rd person model replaced by the M4-M203 placehold due to crashes

## v9.71.11
- **Pipebomb** alt-fire displays the placed pipebomb count (thanks [FishFlop_The_CatSlap])
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: added map aliases for *KF-SunnyLandSanitarium-SE*
- *ScrnMapInfo.ini*: added `BoringStage`, `bOnlyInvisibleZVol`, `ZVolLinks`, and `bDebug`
- `DebugZedSpawn` console command now marks spawn locations (withs only in solo or listen server mode)
- HUD: Perk Bonus Level is not drawn if it is equal to 6 and the XP level >= 6.
- HUD: XP Progress Bar is drawn only in the Scoreboard mode.
- SUPPORT, ALERT, and DIRECTION messages use team messages (TeamSay)
- **M203** grenade cost raised to $15 (up from $10)

#### Heavy Machinegunner

- **M41A** now has laser sights
- **M41A** primary damage reduced to 75 (down from 82)
- **M41A** grenade type chaged to M203 (from M32)
- **M41A** grenade capacity raised to 12 (up from 8)
- **Stinger Minigun** weight raised to 14kg (up from 13) to prevent carrying it along with PKM.
- **Stinger Minigun** fire rate reduced to 1800 RPM (down from 2000)
- **Stinger Minigun** cost raised to $7500 (up from $5000)
- **PKM** weight raised to 12kg (up from 11)
- **M249** weight raised to 12kg (up from 11)


## v9.71.10
#### FastTrack
- Zeds go to a random place on the map after spawn. Only then do they move to the player. It may add variety to the zed attack paths. However, it increases the time between spawning and engaging (slower spawns) on big maps. Zed may also get stuck on small maps with narrow corridors.
- **FastTrack** eliminates the initial random roam and redirects Zeds straight to the players after spawning.
- FastTrack can be configured per-map - see `bFastTrack` in *ScrnMapInfo.ini*
- By default, FastTrack is enabled for Aperture, Farm, Hell Ride, Hospital Horrors, Mountain Pass, and Transit.
- Players can force FastTrack via `MVOTE BORING` (see `BoringFastTrack` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*)
- Setting `BoringFastTrack=0` forces FastTrack on all maps
- `bRandomSpawnLoc=true` in *ScrnWaves.ini* disables FastTrack.
- FastTrack is disabled in **FTG** or during a Boss wave.
- FastTrack can be forced per-wave by setting `bForceFastTrack=true` in *ScrnWaves.ini*
#### FTG
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: added `FtgRule`
- Fixed Stinky CLot movement speed in a boss wave.
- The base gets marked when the player is outside it.

#### ScrN Zed Pack
- Fixed **Tesla Husk** ability to *unweld* doors
- Fixed HardPat's head hitbox while firing minigun or multiple rockets.
- ScrnZedPack.ini: `bCommandoRevealsStalkers=true` by default (you can still change it)
- ScrnZedPack.ini: added `bLegacyHusk` and `bLegacyFleshpound`
- Legacy Fleshpound starts raging immediately after taking enough damage, while the new one tries to attack the player first if the latter is in melee range.
- **Grittier Fleshpound** always has the new behaviour, regardless of the `bLegacyFleshpound` setting.
- The New FP behaviour was hardcoded since v9.69.39. Now, it is configurable.
- The New **Husk** has the same fireballs as the Grittier Husk, but the former fires only one at a time (thanks *Mortimer*).
- New Husk fireballs have collision and can hit players or zeds. Legacy fireballs rely on the splash damage only.
- **Grittier Scrake** unstuns from 150+ explosive damage. Don't nade Scrakes!
- **Grittier Scrake** no longer has the slomo rage exploit.
- **Jason** code cleanup.
-
## v9.71.07
- Duplicate votes result into `MVOTE YES`. For instance, when two players did `MVOTE END TRADE`, it results into a single vote with two YES votes instead of failing the second vote (thanks [FishFlop_The_CatSlap])
- Fixed an issue where "v22 - No" sometimes didn't trigger `MVOTE NO` (thanks [FishFlop_The_CatSlap])

## v9.71.06
- Yet another **QuickMelee** fix

## v9.71.05
- Fixed and issue where **DDT** did not increase the "Donated Cash" stat

## v9.71.04
- Adjusted game modes for map achievement requirements:
  - Suicidal: FTG, ESC (Escape The Hunter), Social Isolation, or any custom game (GameLength >= 60)
  - HoE: XCM, Nightmare, Doom3
- Players cannot fill the next Zed Time Bucket while the Zed Time is active.
- Fixed `ZedTimeTrigger` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*
- Added `ZedTimeChanceMult` to *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*, too. Previously, it was available only in *ScrnGames.ini*
- Added `ZT_Custom` for modders to override Zed Time behavior.

## v9.71.03
- **Predictable Zed Time** - see `ZedTimeTrigger` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*
- Per-game Zed Time settings: `ZedTimeTrigger`, `ZedTimeChanceMult`, `ZedTimeDuration` in *ScrnGames.ini*
- Default Zed Time duration incereased to 4s (up from 3s) to allow weapon switch within ZT
- The original ZT duration can be restored by setting `ZedTimeDuration` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* or *ScrnGames.ini*
- New perk function `ScrnVeterancyTypes.GetZedTimeChance()` - can be ovverrided by custom ScrN perks to modify ZT chance on a zed kill.
- **Combat Medic**: reduced Zed Time extensions to 5 (down from 6) to compensate for ZT duration increase
- Fixed **M4-203** burst fire during Zed Time
- Changed dual pistol fire order when switched from the single pistol
- Restored S/A fire mode of **Tommy Gun** SP & RS (community request)
- **Manual Reload** disabled by default (community request). ScrN veterans already have it enabled, while newcomers may struggle to find R on the keyboard. I cannot believe I'm doing this :facepalm:
- Fixed the double reload bug where a tactical reload could trigger immediately after the full reload when Manual Reload disabled.
- Added `bShowCowboyMode` to *ScrnUser.ini* (enabled by default)
- **DDT**: Dosh receiver gets a notification message (thanks [That1Guy])
- **DDT**: Fixed `ScrnTraderPlayerList.KFGRI` null reference warning (thanks [That1Guy])
- New map alias: `KF-Steamland_Fogged` => `KF-Steamland` (*ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*)
- **Escape The Hunter v1.02** - "Finish them off" waves changed to "Kill half zeds"
- **Circus Husk** disabled by default due to similarity to Tesla Husk. It still can be restored in *ScrnZeds.ini*

## v9.71.01
- **Support Specialist** gained extra damage bonus against Gorefasts.
- **Pump** and **Combat Shotguns** now have higher body damage while retaining the original headshot damage
- **KSG** restored the original fire rate
- Fixed an issue where **Boomstick** sometimes didn't reload due to netcode.
- Fixed an issue when dead zeds continued blocking players for a fraction of a second.
- Team Wallet gets emptied at the beginning of earn/grab dosh waves to prevent cheating (thanks [nmmblez])
- Fixed an issue in **XCM Duel** where Human Damage was enabled in Wave 1.

#### ScrN Weapon Pack
- **SPAS** now have higher body damage while retaining the original headshot damage

## v9.71
#### DO$H
- New feature: **Digital Dosh Transfer (DDT)**. Allows transfering dosh to other players from the Trader Menu.
- DDT allows sharing dosh with the team by sending dosh to the Team Wallet, where everybody can use it.
- New Trader button: "Request Dosh" - allows doing "v13 - I Need Money" without exiting the Trader.
- A dosh request puts the player on top of the DDT player list and marks it so the teammates can identify those in need.
- If a player abuses dosh requests, blame them (`MVOTE BLAME`). Blame vote clears the dosh request mark.
- Blamed players cannot use voice communication commands (vXX) for one minute after the blame.
- Blame message (poop) display time reduced to one minute - to match the communication ban.
- New Trader button: "F7 Armor" - quickly repairs the current armor or buys a new one.
- New Trader button: "F9 Share Dosh" - share all dosh with the team.
- The "F10 Exit" button received a new hotkey. Esc works, too.
- Players can quickly refill everyhing, share spare dosh, then exit the trader by pressing buttons: **F7, F8, F8, F9, F10**.
- There is no typo in the line above. The first F8 fills weapon ammo without resupplying nades or pipebombs. The second click restocks nades and pipebombs.
- "Sell Offperk" / "Sell ALL" button hotkeys changed to `Ctrl+Backspace` / `Ctrl+Shift+Backspace`
- Improved netcode in the Trader Menu
- The default dropped dosh amount is set to $100 (up from $50). Players can still drop $50 by executing `TossCash 50`
- Dropped dosh objects combine on touching each other.
- Dosh object size scales by the dosh amount.

#### Side Arm Selection
- The selection of single-handed weapons made twice as fast (single pistols, knife, machete, syringe, welder)
- Switching to a side arm is faster than switching between primary weapons.
- Fast switching between single and dual pistols via alt-fire
- **Dual Flare Revolvers**: alt-fire switches between single and dual guns

#### Gunslinger
- **Laser .44 Magnums** upgraded to Armor-Piercing rounds.
- Laser and non-laser pistols of the same kind can be carried together.
- Laser .44 Magnums have a separate ammo pool from regular ones due to ammo difference (.44 AP vs. .44)
- **Laser MK23** share the ammo pool with regulal MK23(-s), doubling the ammo capacity.
- 30% Fire rate bonus on **Flare Revolvers**
- Flare impact kills grant Gunslinger XP (not iDoT kills)
- Discount and reload bonus on **Medic Pistol**
- Extra +10% damage bonus on **LAR** to kill HoE Clots with one body shots. Previously, it left a Clot with 3hp.
- **LAR** in Gunslinger's hands can flinch-lock Scrakes like HC.
- Fixed incorrect sell price of dual pistols
- **Handcannon** starting and max ammo adjusted to match full magazines (7, 14)
- **MK23** lowered ammo cost to 14 per magazine (down from 16)

#### ScrnBalanceSrv.ini
- New: `bStoryZedPack` - replaces vanilla Zeds with their ScrnZedPack counterparts
- `AutoLoadMutators=ScrnBalanceSrv.ScrnSpeedMut` enabled by default
- Trader time and starting dosh can be adjusted in *ScrnGames.ini* and *ScrnWaves.ini*
- The config options below are deprecated and hardcoded to the given values:
```ini
bSpawn0=true
bMedicRewardFromTeam=true
bLeaveCashOnDisconnect=true
bNoStartCashToss=false
StartCashNormal=0
StartCashHard=0
StartCashSui=0
StartCashHoE=0
MinRespawnCashNormal=0
MinRespawnCashHard=0
MinRespawnCashSui=0
MinRespawnCashHoE=0
TraderTimeNormal=60
TraderTimeHard=60
TraderTimeSui=60
TraderTimeHoE=60
```

#### ScrnGames.ini
- Deprecated: `bStartingCashReset`, `StartingCashBonus`, `bStartingCashRelative`
- New: `StartDosh`, `StartDoshPerWave`, `StartDoshMin`, `StartDoshMax`

#### Other Changes
- **Syringe**: both healing modes made faster. Pro players are using macros to skip healing animations anyway, while newbies were unnecessarily struggling for too long.
- Classic HUD shows health in green when the player is healing up to the max health (current health + healing bar = max health)
- **MP5M**: Removed tactical reload as being unrealistic.
- **MP5M**: Regular reload made faster to compensate for tactical reload removal.
- Blocked weapons (*ScrnGames.ini*) do not spawn on the map anymore (thanks [nmmblez])
- **ScrN Objective Mode** now uses **ScrN Zed Pack** (see `bStoryZedPack` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*)
- If a player has >100 armor, the cyan bar is drawn on the blue background. It fixes the issue where players with slightly above 100 armor looked like they did not have armor at all.
- `bLowAmmoColorSwitch` added to *ScrnUser.ini* - low ammo counter blinks between red to yellow like the low HP counter.
- Fixed an issue where dead player bodies could stay forever on the map
- Spectators may join after the game has ended to participate in the next map voting.

#### Known Issues
- Trader Menu shows the full price of dual pistols despite the single exists in the inventory. Only half of the cost is actually charged, though.
- Trader Menu ignores single pistol weight when upgrading to dual pistols, requiring the player to have free weight for single+dual (10kg in the case of Handcannons). As a workaround, temporarily drop other weapons while upgrading to dual pistols.

#### Code Changes
- Refactored the healing code. Medic reward calculation moved to `ScrnHumanPawn.TakeHealing()`. Make sure to check your custom medic guns for ScrN compatibility.
- `ScrnHumanPawn.AssessThreatTo()` logic moved to `ScrnPawnFunc`, allowing easy overides.
- Added `ScrnVotingHandlerMut.bVotedPlayerAutoVote`
- Moved global functions from `ScrnBalanceSrv.ScrnFunctions` to `ScrnShared.ScrnF`

#### ScrN Zed Pack
- Pat dead body stays longer on the map
- SC/FP/JS/FFP/BR dead bodies stay longer at high-quality physics settings.

#### ScrN Weapon Pack
- Faster selection of **Medic Pistol** and **Colt**
- **Colt** received Horzine modification to .50 AE rounds. Extra damage to Fleshpouds.
- **Colt** price incereased to 1750 (up from 1250)

#### Horzine Technicial
- **Cryo Harpoon Bomber**: tactical reload gives +1 ammo (3 in the magazine + 1 in the barrel)


## v9.70.18
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: added `bLateJoinersSpectate` to force late joiners to spectators by default - with exception of reconnecting players.
- Spectators may spawn immediately after joining the game during Trader Time.
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: `WaveHeader`, `WaveTitle`, and `WaveMessage` support color tags.
- **SpeedMut**: proportionally increased burning DoT
- **Husk Gun**: 20% faster charging

## v9.70.15
- Last zeds in a wave get auto-marked.
- Added "End Wave" button to ScrN Features. The button cycles between "Boring / End Wave / End Trade" depending on the current game state.
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: deprecated `MaxVoteKillHP` - replaced by `MaxVoteKillBounty`.
- Reverted the shotgun change from 9.70.12. Now shotguns can do damage twice without scoring a headshot. For example, "LAW+HSg" team combo works again now.
- **Boomstick** (HSg) weight lower to 8 (down from 10) and max ammo to 36, perked 46 (down from 54), enhancing loadout variety.
- **Boomstick** pellet base damage raise to 60 (up from 50), headshot multiplier lowered to x1.25 (down from x1.50). Headshot damage remains the same.
- Fixed a bug where a **nail** could push a zed through a wall (floor, ceiling), e.g., on KF-Swamp. Zeds may still get stuck in walls on maps with complex geometry, but at least they get stuck on the right side of the wall.
- Carry weight bonus (>15) doesn't slow down players anymore (Support Spec., HMG). Unlike vanilla, these perks do not receive a low-weight speed bonus either.
- *ScrnGames.ini*: added `SuicideTimePerPlayerDeath`
- **XCM v1.04**: a player death adds +30s to the suicide timer. That allows the remaining players to finish the wave when the timer is tight already.

#### Zed Pack
- Fixed an issue where **Hard Pat** could shoot rockets without arming
- **Grittier Siren** cannot be scream-canceled anymore
- Lowered **Jason** bounty to $125 (down from $300)

#### Horzine Technician
- New weapon: **Cryo Harpoon Bomber** - a remake of Seal Squeal (thanks [ivanmagadan] for the idea)


## v9.70.12
### Shop Menu Overhaul
#### Weapon Search Textbox
- Added Weapon Search Textbox, allowing to quickly search for weapons to buy.
- Weapon Search Textbox is focused by default when entering the Shop Menu. Press `F3` anywhere in the Shop Menu to focus it again.
- Weapon Search is tokenized by words. For example, entering "med pis" finds "Medic Pistol".
- Pressing `Enter` from Weapon Search Textbox buys the selected weapon. You can also press Up/Down arrow keys to quickly navigate through search results.
#### Perk Selection Submenu
- Removed Quick Perk Selection
- Perk/Store buttons replaced with a single "Change Perk" button.
- Perk list now displays 9 items at once, avoiding scrolling for Gunslinger or Combat Medic seletion.
- Quick Perk selection by pressing number keys (`1`..`9`).
- Perk confirmation on `Enter`.
- Return to Shop on `Esc`. Previously, pressing Escape exited the Shop Menu.
- `F9` - hotkey to open/close Perk Submenu
- For example, switching to Commando can be as easy as pressing 3 keys: `F9`, `4`, `Enter`.
#### Shop Menu
- **9mm Pistol** moved under Equipment
- New "Sell Off-Perk" / "Sell ALL" weapons button. The first click sells all off-perk weapons. The second one sells all weapons but the starting equipment. 1kg items (Machete, Pipe Bombs) are excluded from the off-perk category, so they are not sold on the first click.
- `Ctrl+F9` sells off-perk weapons.
- `Ctrl+Shift+F9` sells all weapons (simulates the button double-click)
- There can be up to 12 weapon category icons now.
- Fixed a rare issue where trader inventory did not update after selling a weapon.
- Shop Menu displays Medic Gun healing info

### Lobby Marks
- Now, players can mark locations on the map during Lobby time, for insstance, to suggest the camping spot.
- Press "View Map" button in the Lobby to browse the map.
- Go to location you want to map and press the `Mark` or "Lets hole up here!" key to leave the mapk. Keep in mind that the Speech Menu does not work for spectators, so v35 will NOT work. You have to bind a dedicated key for `Mark` or `speech ALERT 4`.
- You can add a custom label to the mark by typing in the console `mark <my label name>`. For example, `mark Weld this door!`.
- Lobby marks can be colored via color tags, e.g., `mark ^3this is yellow mark`

### Weapon/Money Balance
- Players don't drop spawn inventory on death. They drop only the weapons they have bought + the current weapon.
- Selling Dual Pistols sells them BOTH. The only exception is 9mm pistol.
- `Dual-9mm Pistols` now weight 2kg and cost $200 (mainly, to bypass new Shop Menu checks).
- Restored **Combat Shotgun** flashlight. Laser sights automatically turns off when the flashlight is active.
- Fixed a shotgun exploit where it was possible to do damage twice to the same zed without scoring a headshot.
- Fixed yet another bug in **Healing Projectile** hit detection.
- **M7A3M**: damage rased to 80 (up from 70)
- Reworked **M7A3M** healing projectile: now it consumes 100% of the charge but heals 20hp instantly + 50hp over time (offperk), 35+87hp if healed by a lv6 Field Medic or 26+65 - Combat Medic.
- Fixed an issue where **Buzzsaw** Blade couldn't hit the same target again after bouncing off a wall.

### Game Modes
- **TSC**: players get thrown out of enemy shop immediately when pressing the USE key
- **FTG**: Base light color turned green by default (can be replaced via `GuardianHue`), and lowered its radius and brightness.
- **XCM v1.03**: disabled random player start, added wave (challenge) names
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: added `GuardianLight` and `GuardianHue` for TSC/FTG global overrides
- *ScrnMapVote.ini*: `GuardianHueBlue` and `GuardianHueBlue` replaced by `GuardianHue`, which is available in FTG only.
- *ScrnMapVote.ini*: enhanced KF-EvilSantasLair
- *ScrnMapVote.ini*: lowered zed spawn rate on KF-HospitalHorrors to partially compensate for improved spawns.
- *KFMapVote.ini* cleanup - removed many game mod variation from the official rotation, leaving only the core/recommended game modes. The rest of game modes are still available and can be restored by uncommenting the respective `GameConfig` lines.

### Other Changes
- Added difficulty voting GUI setting
- Fixed a state sync issue between `ScrnGameType` and `ScrnBalance` during the first second of Trader Time begin/end
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: added `bLouderZeds`
- Fixed a warning in `ScrnHumanPawn.SetWeaponAttachment()`

### ScrN Zed Pack
- **Hard Pat**: lowered charging minigun speed multiplier (x2.3 => x1.75)
- **Hard Pat** always charges player with minigun after the final healing (previously, it was 40% chance)
- **Hard Pat**: when firing multiple rockers, reduced the splash radius of subsequent rockets by 20%

### ScrN Weapon Pack
- Fixed **HK417** bringup/putdown animations
- Slightly boosted **CZ805M** healing recharge rate
- Increased max ammo for **SVD** (90 => 100), **SVDS** (60 => 70), **Hunting Rifle** (50 => 70)
- Increased **SVDS** fire rate (0.75s => 0.5s)


## v9.70.01
- New **Gunslinger** perk icon
- Enhanced some perk icons
- FTG/TSC: Fixed glowing of some player models

## v9.70
#### Feature Summary (from 9.69.39)
- New feature - **MARK** (a.k.a. **SPOT** or **PING**).
- A brand new game mode - **52. Escape the Hunter** (by [nmmblez])
- Remastered Doom Demon Invasion into a new game mode - **20. New Doom**
- Improved headshot detection (once more)
- Enhanced Zed Spawning system.

#### Mark (Ping / Spot)
- New feature - **Mark** (a.k.a. *spot* or *ping*) - an ability to mark big zeds or items (ammo, weapons, armor) on the map. Teammates can see the marks (even through walls). Marks disappear in 5..10 seconds.
- By default, the marking feature is used via the Speech Menu Command v31 ("Lookout!") - marks the zed or item the player is looking at.
- The recommended way is binding the `MARK` command to a separate key (`set input T MARK` or via *ScrN Key Bindings* GUI).
- Some Speech Menu items mark the player: v11 ("Medic"), v12 ("Help"), v33 ("Wait for me!"), v36 ("Follow me")
- v13 ("I need some money") - also marks the player, but only during the Trader Time.
- v35 ("Lets hole up here!") - marks the player location and may stay up to the end of the Trader Time (30s max)
- Marking can be prohibited on the server by setting `MarkDistanceMeters=0` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*
- Players can locally disable marks by setting `bShowMarks=false` in *ScrnUser.ini* (a GUI option will come later)
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: new option `MarkDistanceMeters` - maximum distance to item/zed to set/reveal a mark.
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: new option `MarkZedBounty` - filters out markable zeds by their Bounty (`ScoringValue`). By default, Husks, Scrakes and Fleshpounds are markable (and also Brutes, Jasons, Female FP, and upper roster of DooM demons). Patriarch cannot be marked to avoid exploits.
   Note that if a marked player or enemy is too far away, their marked location is not updated on move. This is designed behavior.

#### Escape The Hunter
- A new game mode by [nmmblez] included into the official rotation. The game loop is opposite from FTG: players must run away from the **Chaser** (Invulnerable Hunter's cousin) instead of following the guardian until the timer runs out.
- The game mode provides a unique KF experience but cannot be enjoyed by the mentally disabled.

#### New Doom
- Totally reworked Doom 3 Demon Invasion mode to use modern ScrN features. A long game, 16+1 waves: 4 regular waves + 2 mid-game boss fights + 6 random waves + 6 trader paths + final boss battle. Each of the 8 Doom bosses now has its unique wave. A mid-game boss wave ends when the boss is defeated. Other enemies don't matter. Moreover, only killing the boss grants dosh.
- Significantly improved Doom AI, especially projectile aiming. On Suicidal/HoE, ranged Doom Demons better predict a player movement and may shoot the ground beneath the player for splash damage.
- Enhanced almost all Doom Demons. Read *README.md* in ScrnDoom3KF for more details.

#### Money Balance
- Players now lose constant amount of dosh on death (instead if % of total money).
- By default, a player death subtracts from $100 both from player and team wallet ($200 in total).
- In **TSC** and Tourney, a death "costs" -$250 for the player and the team.
- If killed by an enemy player in TSC, the killer and their team gains +$250, shifting the overall team dosh balance by $1000 in total.

#### Weapon Balance
- **M7A3** magazine capacity raised to 20 (up from 15)
- **Combat Medic** melee speed bonus raised to +100% (up from +75%) to match Berserker's DPS.
- Removed a flashlight from **Combat Shotgun** as it looked silly together with laser sights. AltFire now toggles LS.
- Added laser sight switching sound for all guns with LS.
- Fixed an issue when `ToggleFlashlight` could switch to Combat Shotgun which does not have a flashlight anymore. Now, `ToggleFlashlight` also can switch to custom weapons that have a flashlight.

#### ScrN Games/Waves/Zeds
- "23. Late Pure Doom" and "41. FTG Survival Competition" removed from the official rotation due to `GameConfig` 4095-char limit.
- Now end-game bosses can be spawned separately (e.g., `SpecialSquads=BOSS1 | BOSS2`)
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: Added `bNoBounty` and `CashBonus`.
- If the wave got picked randomly, its Header/Title/Message is not revealed until the trader time ends
- Faster zed spawning at the beginning of a wave.
- If there are not enough zeds on the map, new ones are always spawned close to players, ignoring other settings, such as `bRandomSpawnLoc`. "Enough" currently means `4 * AlivePlayerCount`, capped at 16 (24 in TSC).
- `MVOTE BORING` spawns zeds closer to players even if `bRandomSpawnLoc=true`
- *ScrnGames.ini*: New config options: `MinBonusLevel`, `MaxBonusLevel`, `bUniqueWaves`
- *ScrnGames.ini*: `LaterWavePct` and  `LaterWaveSpawnCooldown` deprecated. Set `SpawnRateMod` in each wave instead.
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: New config option - `ZedsBeforeSpecialSquad`
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: adjusted `SpawnRateMod` to compensate for `LaterWaveSpawnCooldown` removal.
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: `SpecialSquadCooldown` now is set in seconds instead of multiplier. The end result is the same for maps with default `WaveSpawnPeriod=2.0`. However, WaveSpawnPeriod no longer affects the cooldown.
- *ScrnWaves.ini*: New wave end rule - `RULE_KillSpecial` () - kill the special squad (e.g., a mid-game boss) to end the wave. `RULE_KillBoss` automatically switches to `RULE_KillSpecial` if used anywhere but the final wave.
- *ScrnMapInfo.ini*: Added `ZedSpawnMinDistWeight` to limit zed spawn range on very big maps (e.g., *KF-Boardwalk*)
- **72. Mystery Game** - updated to v2.02. Added new wave "Big Fat Kenny" to demonstrate `RULE_KillSpecial`.

#### TSC / FTG
- `bScrnWaves=True` hardcoded in **TSC** and **FTG** (previously it was hardcoded in TSC only)
- Players glow when are a subject of friendly fire (human damage), e.g., outside the base during a wave.
- Players can adjust the glow color in *ScrnUser.ini* (client-side)
- **FTG**: disabled player auto-blame for setting a base in a glitch spot (community request)

#### Other Changes
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: New config option `bKickBan` in
- **12. Noob Trinity** game mode now runs at uncapped bonus levels.
- *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*: new option `ZedToZedDamageMult` (default=5.0) to boost the damage Zeds deal to each other.
- Added Kill/Death/Dosh totals on the scoreboard.
- Added a proper HUD widget for the movement speed.
- Replaced the ugly weight numbers with the normal ones. By default, only the current weight is displayed. When Scoreboard is opened, the value changes to the max weight. Same with the speed.
- NearDeathOverlay is used what the player (or spectated pawn) has <25HP, not <25%.
- Some minor HUD improvements
- `KFRandomAmmoSpawn` items are automatically deleted from the map as those are leftovers from KFMod and do not work well in KF1.
- Fixed a log spam when an ammo box gets destroyed mid-game. This happens only on badly designed maps.
- Fixed "Sole Survivor" stat (thanks [Broski])
- Fixed color tag parsing is some console messages
- Fixed color tag parsing in Marco's Multi-Kill Messages (e.g, "^1Fresh ^2Meat +2 Scrake kills")

#### Code changes
- Moved many generic helper functions from ScrnBalanceSrv to ScrnShared.
- Localized generic messages in ScrN Voting Handler (may cause compatibility issues)
- `mvote HELP` is still parsed server-side and not localized yet.

#### ScrN Zed Pack
- Improved headshot detection while a Zed is moving and attacking at the same time.
- **Husk** and **Tesla Husk** bounty raised to 35 (up from 17 and 25, respectively) to match `MarkZedBounty`. The Original bounty was ridiculously low.
- Added `bCommandoRevealsStalkers` config option for Commando to reveal Stalkers for all teammates (like in KF2)
- `bCommandoRevealsStalkers` does not affect Ghosts
- Refactored Stalker and Ghost code
- Fixed a warning: "PlayAnim: Sequence 'Jump' not found for mesh 'Patriarch_Freak'"
- Fixed a network replication bug where sometimes a decapitated **Bloat** kept his head client-side.

#### Heavy Machinegunner
- **XMV850** laser sight is turned on by default.
- Fixed `ChainGun.SelectedHudImageRef` (thanks [P-Jay])

#### Horzine Technician
- Maximum damage that Siren's Sonic Shatter can do per each shattered zed is capped at 80 on Normal, 140 - HoE.
- Frozen zeds now receive minor Damage over Time (DoT).
- Increased **ZED Gun MKI** damage to 100 (up from 85)
- Increased **ZED Gun MKII** damage to 80 (up from 50)
- **Cryo Thrower** weight lowered to 7 (down from 8)

### v9.69.39
- Added dedicated commands for sprinting: `StartSprint` and `StopSprint`.
- The new key binding for the sprint is `StartSprint | Button bSprint | onrelease StopSprint`. Rebind the sprint key in GUI.
- The new sprint command works for spectators too, significantly boosting camera movement speed.
- Spectators can use `SetSpectateSpeed <X>` to change the camera speed. The default value is 600.
- **Speed Mut**: restored the original melee movement speed bonus to 20% (up from 15%) to avoid inconsistencies where Medic with Syringe or Gunslinger with dual pistols moved faster than with a knife.
#### ScrN Zed Pack
- Restored the original **Circus Husk** (Dancing Robot) - community request
- Improved headshot detection for jumping/falling zeds on dedicated servers
- Fixed an exploit when Fleshpound did not rage when dealing a massive damage during attack animation.
- Now, FP rages immediately after finishing the attack animation (on Suicidal and HoE)

### v9.69.38
- Yet another bugfix in `QuickMelee`
- Laser sights are switched ON by default for MK23/.44
#### ScrN Zed Pack
- Fixed a network replication bug where sometimes decapitated zeds kept their heads client-side

### v9.69.37
- Added `PerPlayerExclude` to *ScrnWaves.ini*. Allows wave counter increase for big teams only.
- **FTG**: Stinky Clot teleports next to the Guardian if it couldn't been reached in ~2 minutes.

### v9.69.36
- Adjusted **Knife** select animation rate
#### FTG
- Stinky Clot spawns an extra extra ammo box per 3 players in the team (1 box for 1-2p, 2: 3-5p, 3: 6-8p, etc.).
- Extra ammo is spawned only if players manage to quickly pickup the previous box.
- Stinky Clot's movement speed reduction triggers instantly on all players leaving the base.
  Previously, Stinky could keep the previous speed for the next 5-10s.
- Fixed an issue where sometimes FTG required at least 2 players to start the match
#### Code Changes
- `TheGuardian` renamed to `FtgBaseGuardian` along with its Blue and Red subclasses.

### v9.69.35
- Added **Sprint** key binding, which results in `GetWeapon ScrnKnife | onrelease SwitchToLastWeapon`. In other words, the sprint key selects the knife while holding it and switches back to the last weapon on release. KF1 players have been doing that manually for over a decade with no problems, but those who moved from KF2 keep complaining.
- Switching from/to the knife made faster for fluent "sprinting".
- Added "Sprint" and "Cook Grenade" key bindings to Settings / Controls / ScrN Features
- Removed "Enable Grenade Cooking" checkbox from ScrN Features since it is replaced by the separate key binding. Now, player can bind two nade keys: 1) cook 2) throw (for fast throwing). It was possible before the patch too, but was less convinient.
- `bReplaceNades` deprecated
- Fixed nade cooking for **Combat Medic**
- Fixed an issue where custom key bindings appeared twice on the GUI page
- ScrN Key Bindings appear on GUI even if ScrN Balance is not installed locally.
- Added localization for Map Achievements
- **ScrnWelder** - no changes from the vanilla welder. It was the last one KFMod "weapon" that hasn't been ported to ScrN. Not it is.
- New game mode: **12. Headshots Prefered** - a medium game with perk restriction to Sharpshooter, Commando, and Gunslinger only. Weapon restriction to only those that are capable of scoring headshots. Hand nades prohibited too.
- New game mode: **12. Noob Trinity** - perk restriction to Firebug, Demolition, and Heavy Machinegunner. 100% fun, 0% skill.
- Turbo Game removed from the official rotation (deprecated by SpeedMut). Still available in the package.
- "73. Half-Long Game" and "81. Fight the Patriarchs" removed from the official rotation due to `GameConfig` 4095-char limit.
- Newcomers receive a welcome message when first time joining an ScrN server

### v9.69.33
- **Pre-Aiming** - allows holding the Aim button while reloading or switching weapons to begin aiming ASAP. Originally, premature button press did nothing and required the player to release and press the button again.
- Fixed an issue where it was possible to set players on fire despite their immunity to fire damage (Firebugs, teammates, etc. )
- Fixed Trader Speed Boost at the start of the Trader Time (thanks *Mortimer*)
- Trader Speed Boost is applied only when Trader doors are open
- Possible fix for the "LAW not firing" bug (thanks [ivanmagadan])
- Achievement names and descriptions made localized in the following packages:
  ScrnBalanceSrv, ScrnWeaponPack, ScrnHTec, ScrnD3Ach

### v9.69.30
- New game mode **"10. KF Classic 1016"** - restricts perk and weapon loadout to KF v1016 (2010) - the last balanced vanilla version of the game. (check *KFMapVote.ini*)
- ScrN **Demolitions Expert** spawns with **M4-203** by default. This weapon was not available in v1016, so the following workaround should be added to *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* (the default config is already patched) to make Demo spawn with M79 in 1016:
```ini
SpawnInventory=6:ScrnBalanceSrv.ScrnM4203Pickup:0-255:60+15:150
SpawnInventory=6-1:ScrnBalanceSrv.ScrnM79Pickup:0-255:12+1:150
```
- New game mode **"11. ScrN Classic 1034"** - restricts perk and weapon loadout to KF v1034 + ScrN Balance v1 (2012) - just before the "M99 era" (no DLC weapons). **Gunslinger** is already available.
- Per-game weapon and perk restriction. Check `AllowWeaponPackages`, `AllowWeaponLists`, `AllowPerks`, and their "Block-" counterparts in *ScrnGames.ini* .
- New config file *ScrnWeaponLists.ini* used for per-game weapon restriction.
- New config option `bMedicNades` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* to restore healing hand grenades for **Field Medic**. The option is disabled by default, and ScrN recommends to keep it that way. Use **M79M/M203M** medic grenade launchers instead. Added by the community request. **Tourney Mode** forces `bMedicNades=false`.
- Fixed the dual pistol fire order issue on high ping servers, where sometimes only one of the pistols was firing all rounds (thanks [ImmortalNub])

### v9.69.29
- `mutate zed <alias> spawn` command now spawns the last used zed index instead of the first one.
  For example:
```
mutate zed CL spawn         // spawns regular clot
mutate zed CL 3 spawn       // spawns xmas clot
mutate zed CL spawn         // spawns xmas clot
```
- This feature can be used on **KFT-ScrnTestGrounds-SE** to pre-select the zed variant to spawn on shooting plates.

### v9.69.28
- Fixed weapon fire **spread** calculation during Zed Time in **Story Game** too
- Fixed movement speed calculation after picking/dropping a story item
- **FTG**: Scaled Stinky Clot's movement speed limits according to the original ground speed. Previously, min and max speed were hardcoded constant values. Now, those scale across difficulty and affected by **Speed Boost** mutator.

### v9.69.27
- Fixed weapon fire **spread** calculation during Zed Time.
- Fixed an issue that sometimes caused micro-stuttering due to player speed desync.
- Unfortunately, the micro-stuttering fix prevents **Combat Medic** to gain speed boost in Zed Time.
- **Combat Medic** deals double damage during Zed Time (as compensation for the speed boost removal)

### v9.69.26
- Fixed path to Stinky Clot in **FTG** (the green trail).
- Changed ammo amount received from an ammo box for players with full guns (100% ammo):
  - if the player has only one weapon that requires ammo (9mm and nades excluding), the gun receives double the amount.
  - if the player has no guns that require ammo (except 9mm), he/she receives two nades instead of one.
  - if the player has full ammo and nades, he/she receives extra 60 9mm rounds.
- Buzzsaw Bow ammo pickup amount lowered to 1 (down from 2) to compensate for the above changes since Buzzsaw Bow usually is the only non-melee weapon in a Berserker's loadout (so Berserker will get two blades anyway).
- Added duplicate check to `GunSkin` command (thanks [ivanmagadan])
- New helper functions: `class'ScrnFunctions'.static.AddGunSkin()` and `RemoveGunSkin()`

### v9.69.25
#### New Mutator - Speed Boost
- Boosts movement speed of players and zeds, leading to a faster gameplay pace.
- Speed Boost mutator is optional and disabled by default.
- To enable speed boost for all game types, add `AutoLoadMutators=ScrnBalanceSrv.ScrnSpeedMut` to *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*.
- To enable speed boost for particular games only, add `Mutators=ScrnBalanceSrv.ScrnSpeedMut` to either *ScrnGames.ini* or *KFMapVote.ini*.
- Zed movement speed increased by 25%.
- Player base speed speed increased by 30%: 200 => 260 uups. Note that other aspects of the game, like fire or reload rate, are unchanged, so players need more boost to stay on par with zeds.
- Melee speed bonus lowered to 15% (down from 20%) - switching to knife grants aprox. +40 uups like in the base game.
- Heavy melee weapons, while equipped, slow down players by 4 uups/kg (up from 2).
- Low health does not slow the player down.
- Increased weight's effect on movement. Each 1kg reduces speed by 3 uups. For instance, a Commando carrying only a SCAR moves by 30 uups faster than a fully stacked (15/15) player.
- Reduced falling damage.
- Added **Bunny-hopping**. While bunny-hopping does not grant a significant speed bonus, it may entertain players during boring trader runs.
- Other speed boosts, such as Machete-sprint or TraderSpeedBoost, are disabled when using the Speed Boost mutator.

#### Balance
- Berserker is immune to falling damage


### v9.69.23
- If a player placed more **pipebombs** than their perk allows to carry, the *oldest* pipebombs get blown up at the beginning of the next wave. Previously, the newest pipebombs got destroyed.
- Optimized game loading sequence

### v9.69.22
- **FTG**: fixed a bug where spectators did not switch team after joining the game.
- Fixed Hardcore mode replication if changed via `mvote diff HoE+` (thanks *Mortimer*)

### v9.69.21
- Added `ServerPackages` to *ScrnGames.ini*. Allows loading extra packages for specific games.
- Added `bStartingCashReset` to *ScrnGames.ini*.
- Added **XCM DUEL** game mode to *ScrnGames.ini* (GameLength=47). Previously, XCM DUEL was using the regular XCM mode (GameLength=7)
- Fixed an issue where a player could cook grenade during pause.

#### TSC
- New TSC **20/80** rule - each team needs to kill at least 20% zeds in every wave. Failing to do so leads to the loss at the end of the wave.
- The 20/80 rule applies only when both teams survived the wave.
- Added wave kills on TSC HUD and Scoreboard
- Defined specific **TSC Tourney** waves in *ScrnWaves.ini*.
- From now on, TSC Tourney (GameLength=42) is played in 6 regular + 1 overtime + 1 sudden death waves.
- Players start with no cash ($1) in TSC Tourney. However, zed count increased in Wave1 to compensate that.
- TSC Tourney waves are:
  1. TSC1: Wave1 + CR and ST, x4 spawn rate, more ammo and weapons on the map
  2. TSC2: Wave3 with x3 spawn rate
  3. TSC3: Wave6 with x2 spawn rate (x2)
  4. TSC4: Wave7 with faster spawn rate
  5. TSC5: Wave9 with faster spawn rate
  6. TSC6: Wave10 with faster spawn rate
  7. TSCOT: the Overtime wave - a harder version of Wave10
  8. TSCSD: the Sudden Death Wave - a harder version of Wave10 + double spawn rate
- Regular TSC and FTG-SC are still played in standard medium game + TSCOT + TSCSD.
- Fixed a bug where sometimes a TSC game could go endlessly if both teams keep surviving the waves.
- Fixed an exploit where the base could set on the enemy base by stunning the enemy Base Guardian
- Fixed an issue where the message wrongly said "Human Damage ON" during wave 1
- Base Guardian stun damage lowered to 500 (down from 700)
- Base Guarding stun protection at the start of each wave increased to 30s (up from 10s). Players now get a message when stun protection wears off.
- Base Guardian does not heal during 2s after the last damage taken. Previously, Guardian started healing immediately, making next to impossible to stun it with low-damage low-firerate weapons (e.g., 9mm pistol).
- Base Guardian heal rate is 50 hp/s
- Base Guardian does not protect from Human Damage while Waking Up from Stunned. Technically, both Waking Up and Stunned states are the same now; Waking Up just informs the players that the base will become active soon. Stun time is 30s, followed by 10s Waking Up phase. In other words, when the Base Guardian gets stunned, players are not protected from Human Damage for 40s.
- Base direction pointers now indicate if the guardians are stunned.
- Console command: `TeamStats` to display & log team stats (kills, death, etc.) during the match.

#### Clans
- Added clan support to TSC. Clans are defined in *ScrnClans.ini*. See *ScrnClans.sample* for details.
- `mvote CLAN GAME <CLAN_A> <CLAN_B>` starts the clan game between `<CLAN_A>` and `<CLAN_B>`.
- type `mvote CLAN HELP` for details
- Server admins can create clans in-game via `mvote CLAN CREATE` command, then use `mvote CLAN CAPTAIN` and/or `mvote CLAN ADD` to set clan captain and/or add players to the clan.
- Clan captains can add/remove players to/from the clan via `mvote CLAN ADD/REMOVE` commands.
- Clan captains cannot add/remove other captains. That can be done only by a server admin.
- A player can leave the clan via `mvote CLAN LEAVE`. The command works only during the clan game.
- A player can be a member of multiple clans.
- Added clan support to TSC HUD, Scoreboard and Lobby menu. During a clan game, clan logos and names are used instead of the standard British/Steampunk teams.


### v9.69.17
- **FTG On The Clock** v2.50 - now, timer waves last 5 minutes regardless of player count.
- If Stinky Clot prematurely dies (e.g., due to getting stuck or finishing the entire route), the base is automatically set instead of simply dropping the Guardian. Previously, the base was autosetting only during the boss wave.
- Fixed the issue where Guardian Hue was reset to 0 (red color) if not set in ScrnMapInfo.ini
- New config option `bZedFights` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* to prevent zeds from fighting each other.

#### ScrN Zed Pack
- Fixed an expoit where some zeds could not attack a player standing on elevated surface next to them (thanks [Joe])
- https://youtu.be/tTItl1_4834

### v9.69.16
- Enhanced *ScrnMapInfo.ini* with `ZVolDisableTimeMax`, `bVanillaVisibilityCheck`, `ZVolClose` options.
- Added `GuardianHueRed` and `GuardianHueBlue` config options to *ScrnMapInfo.ini* (thanks [nmmblez])
- Added map info for CountyJail
- Fixed map list for **ScrnTestGame**
- Fixed a rare bug where players sometimes could join the Red team in **FTG**
- In TSC/FTG, the base direction arrow starts pulsing when the player is outside the base.
- Renamed some ammo to match real counterparts
- new console command `PERK <perkname>` allows changing perk from console. Values for `<perkname>` are the same as for
  `MVOTE LOCKPERK <perkname>`, e.g. `perk commando`, `perk cmd`, or `perk 4`

#### User-Defined Games/Waves/Zeds
- Controlled by `bUserGames` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*. By default, `bUserGames=false` meaning the legacy behavior - load everything from *ScrnGames.ini* regardless of GameLength.
- If `bUserGames=true`, user-defined games (GameLength from **100** to **199**) use `ScrnUserGameLength` objects from *ScrnUserGames.ini* instead of ScrnGames.ini (see *ScrnUserGames.sample*)
- If `ScrnUserGameLength.bUserWaves=true`, waves are loaded from *ScrnUserWaves.ini* (see *ScrnUserWaves.sample*)
- If `ScrnUserGameLength.bUserZeds=true`, zeds are loaded from *ScrnUserZeds.ini* (see *ScrnUserZeds.sample*)
- Allows users to define custom games/waves/zeds without worrying about them being overwritten by future ScrN releases.
- It is not recommended to modify the default ScrnGames/Waves/Zeds.ini anymore. Make your customizations in ScrnUser*.ini instead.

#### Zed Events
- Changed random zed event behavior in ScrN Games (`bScrnWaves=true`). When `EventNum=254` (random), it picks a random
  EventNum from all loaded `ScrnZedInfo` objects in the current game.
  User-created zed events (e.g., `EvenNum=100` in *ScrnZeds.ini*) now participate in random selection too.
- Added `?ZedEvent=` option to command line / *KFMapVote.ini* to allow choosing a zed event via map voting menu.
- Added `ForceZedEvent` and `FallbackZedEvent` config options to *ScrnGames.ini*

##### Zed Event Priority (from highest to lowest)
1. `ScrnGameLength.bAllowZedEvents`. If false, zed events are disabled; end of story. Otherwise:
2. `ScrnGameLength.ForceZedEvent` if set (>0)
3. `?ZedEvent=` if set (>0)
4. `ScrnBalance.EventNum` if set (>0) and `ScrnBalance.bForceEvent=true`
5. `ScrnMapInfo.ZedEventNum` if set (>0) and `ScrnBalance.bForceEvent=true`
6. `ScrnGameLength.FallbackZedEvent`

#### ScrN Weapon Pack
- **AK12** single fire more replaced with two-shot burst. Headshot multiplier reset back to x1.1 (down from 1.2)


### v9.69.15
- **WARNING!** `ServerPerks.ini` renamed to `ScrnServerPerks.ini`
- Added game type `GT` - a duplicate of `ScrnGameType`. Using GT saves 10 characters per `GameConfig` entry in *KFMapVote.ini* (300 per 30 configs), allowing more entries withing the 4095 character cap.
- New game type `ScrnTestGame` - exclusively for test maps
- Added MapAliases from KF-ScrnTestGrounds to KFT-ScrnTestGrounds and SE versions.
- KF-ScrnTestGrounds-SE should be renamed to **KFT-ScrnTestGrounds-SE**. Any other test maps should have "KFT-" prefix.
- Added `DefaultGameLength` config option to `ScrnGameType`. It allows setting the default game length if there is no `GameLength=` option in the cmd line.
  - ScrnTestGame has `DefaultGameLength=8`
  - TSC and FSC have `DefaultGameLength=40`
  - FTG has `DefaultGameLength=51`


### v9.69.12
- Fixed network sync issue to display the actual health level in the "Medic! (x%)" voice message (v11)
- Fixed health bar display of the spectated player


### v9.69.11 - POST-MORTEM UPDATE

#### Balance
- **Combat Medic** received 30% healing and 50% syringe recharge bonus. Still far worse healing than Field Medic but at least now it is better than off-perk.
- **Katana** restored the vanilla attack speed. Previously, ScrN Katana's Primary Attack was slightly slower.
- **Commando** lost 25% ammo bonus. Base ammo pools readjusted to compensate for the bonus loss.
- **M4-203** marked as a cross-perk weapon (Demo/Commando)
- **M4** received Armor-Piercing rounds.
- All assault rifles with Armor-Piercing rounds received "AP" prefix in their names: "M4 AP", "FN FAL AP", "HK417 AP".
- **FN FAL** price raised to $4000 (up from $2750)
- Significantly raised Armor-Piercing ammo price: $30/mag for M4, $35/mag for FN FAL and HK417.
- Removed **Combat Shotgun** weird "feature" that sometimes dealt 10x damage when shot through Siren Scream.
- Reduced **Flare iDoT** damage progression. Previously, each subsequent flare dealt -25% damage. Now: -33%.

#### Games
- **FTG OTC** v2.41
- Fixed a bug where the remaining zed count got doubled at the wave begin if `bOpenTrader=false`
- Added map info for Transit, HillBillyHorror, SteamLand, Forgotten, Filthscross, and HellRide (by [nmmblez])

#### Code Changes
- Moved utility functions from `ScrnBalance` to `ScrnFunctions` class (by [NikC-])
- Removed hardcoded package names everywhere in the code (by [NikC-])

#### Other Changes
- Voice Messages are not sent to the enemy team in TSC
- Support/Medic! voice message (v11) displays health % of the sender.
- Hidden achievements do not show unless unlocked (e.g., "TSC Tourney Member"). Now hidden achievements do not prevent 100% achievement earn.
- Fixed HUD-related log warnings in Objective Mode.
- Temporarily removed auto-blame for buying OP weapons before the Boss Wave. The feature wasn't intuitive as the players didn't know they shouldn't buy those weapons beforehand.
- Added health bar to spectated player (thanks [ImmortalNub])

#### ScrN Weapon Pack
- Adjusted assault rifle ammo count to compensate for Commando's ammo bonus removal. Keep in mind that "A" custom weapon bonus still adds bonus ammo, so that's should be removed:
```
PerkedWeapons=3:ScrnWeaponPack.CZ805M:$WP
PerkedWeapons=3:ScrnWeaponPack.AKC74AssaultRifle:$WP
PerkedWeapons=3:ScrnWeaponPack.AK12AssaultRifle:$WP
PerkedWeapons=3:ScrnWeaponPack.VALDTAssaultRifle:$WP
PerkedWeapons=3:ScrnWeaponPack.HK417AR:$WP
```
- **AK-74** renamed to **AKS-74** to comply with the weapon model.
- **AKS-74** made a Tier-1 weapon: lowered damage to 38 (down from 42), price to $600 (down from $1150), weight 4 (down from 5).

#### ScrN Zed Pack
- **Husk** cannot shoot while falling, dying, or evading other Husk's fireball (by [NikC-])
- **Siren** stops screaming immediately after dying (by [NikC-])
- **Crawler** cannot attack more than once per second. That fixes instant-kill issues where Crawlers were hitting
  again and again by jumping off each other's back.
- **HardPat** gets 33% damage resistance from Flare iDoT
- **HardPat** gets 25% damage resistance from melee body hits (no resistance to head hits)
- Fixed **FleshPound** dealing insane amount of damage when enraged while performing a hit (thanks [Joe])
- **TeslaHusk** now uses energy on repairing FP/FFP/TH head too. Previously, TH used energy to repair body health only,
  while the head was repaired for "free". On HoE, a fully charged TH can repair up to 3500hp, or 1750 body + 1750 head
  if the head is severely damaged. In previous versions, TH could repair 3500hp body + 3500hp head.
- **TeslaHusk** energy restore rate lowered by 25%. Previously, it took 10s to restore full energy up from 0. Now, it
  takes 12.5s.
- Fixed an issue where sometimes **TeslaHusk** could repair multiple targets in a raw, bypassing the cooldown timer.


### v9.69.09 - FINAL

* **Version number of all ScrN packages bumped to v9.69.09** to be the same for the final release.

* Updated `MapAliases` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*
* Fixed the warning "ShopVolume Accessed None MyTrader"
* If all players die on a test map, the game triggers `RestartPlayers` event, allowing the test map to respawn dead
  players. If the test map does not respawn players, the game is lost.

* Slightly adjusted per-game Hardcore Levels in *ScrnGames.ini*
  <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jd5S5XrgrVjq8V8NvHiTG1y6JgE83yzzBYKBeZjRHsg/edit?usp=sharing>

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Fixed an issue where HopMines were blocked by Blocking Volumes.

### v9.69.07

* Fixed a critical bug that prevented zed spawns in any door-related volumes (thanks [Joe])
  For instance, this bug completely blocked spawns on KF-TheGreatPyramid-Arena.
* Added map definitions for Clandestine and TheGreatPyramid-Arena.
* Hardcore Level in `HardcoreGames` now gets multiplied by per-difficulty `HLMult_X`.
  Previously, players could get "cheap" HL=6 by playing FTG on Normal.

  Now, enabling custom zeds in Social Isolation raises HL.
* `HLMult_Hard=0.60` (down from 0.75)

* Enhanced Stinky Clot's teleportation ability to get out of bad paths
* Fixed an issue where a player could be blamed multiple time for placing the base at a glitch spot

### v9.69.04

* Reduced Demolition's explosive resistance to 70% (down from 80%)
* Hardcore Mode: Reduced Demolition's explosive resistance to 35% (down from 50%)
* Increased Husk Gun ammo to 250/400 base/lv6 (up from 200/320)

* Fixed an issue where wave count displayed 0 in XCM DUEL (e.g., "Wave 3/0").
* "Sell Weapon" button in the Shop changes to "Donate to Charity" if the sell price is $0.
* Minor map improvements in *ScrnMapInfo.ini*

### v9.69.03

* Refactored *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* by commenting out the default values. That allows users to override a default value
  by uncommenting and changing the value. Keeping a value commented means "follow the default value" - if the default
  value changes in next version, it gets automatically applied on the user side without updating the config.
* Added `MaxPauseTime` and `MaxPauseTimePerWave` to *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*
* `bForceManualReload` deprecated
* `VoteSquad` / `MVOTE SPAWN` deprecated due to bugs and exploits
* **Short & Dramatic** game moved to GameLength=62 (from 82) to better indicate that it uses Social Isolation.
* **FTG On The Clock** v2.30 - replaced the introduction wave with modified version of XCM1.
* Fixed an issue where sometimes a healing cloud did not get replicated to other players.

### v9.69.02

* **XCM** v1.00 - final (more or less) release
* Winning a **Nightmare** game (GameLength=9) grants all four map achievements
* Added `HLMult` to *ScrnGames.ini*
* Fixed an issue where `MVOTE DIFF` before the game start didn't recalculate HL.
* Another attempt to fix "All Your Cookies Belong To Me" and "Eye for an Eye" achievements
* Fixed "Balls of Steel" achievement

* Lowered **HRL** damage to 600 (down from 625)
* Changed HK417 achievement requirement to kill 7 Fleshpounds (thanks [Joe])

### v9.69.01

* Slightly lowered Zed count in Doom3 Wave 10
* When playing **Social Isolation** solo, the player always gets sick. Playing SocIso solo is not recommended.
* Reduced achievement player count requirement from 5-6 down to 3-4 where Zed health does not matter (thanks [Joe])
* "Unassisted" can be earned only on HoE (Kill 6p HoE FP)
* "Kenny" requires a game with at least 5 waves.
* Fixed an issue where Speedrun achievements could be earned in shorter games.
* Fixed "All Your Cookies Belong To Me" and "Eye for an Eye" achievements (thanks [Joe])
* `b10Stars` is taken into account when granting perk-color achievements (Gold, Green, Blue, etc.)
* Unlocking Blue perk achievement grants the Green one too. The same applies to Purple and Orange.
  That solves an issue where players may jump from Gold directly to Blue by winning a game with huge end-game bonuses.

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Lowered **HRL** arming distance to 8m (down from 10m) due to reduced explosion radius
* Fixed a bug in "AK Fanboy(-girl)" achievement

#### ScrN Zed Pack

* Fixed a bug that prevented **FP** raging from damage < 300 (behaved like FFP)
* Pat/HardPat's **Radial Attack**:
  * Removed ridiculous double damage to players with >50 armor
  * Made radial damage more consistent and scaled across difficulties.
    Originally, Pat did 54-108 damage to unarmored players, 108 - 216 to armored.
    Now, Pat does 52-87 damage on Hard, Suicidal: 63-105, Hoe: 73-122
  * Radial Attack can be performed only on Hard+ difficulty
  * Damage delivery matches the animation: first, Pat attacks players on the left, then on the right.
    Players straightly in front and at the back are attacked twice.
* Sui/HoE **HardPat**, when low on health, can perform Radial Attack against a single player (thanks [Vrana])
* Increased HardPat impale strike range from 0.9 to ~1.9m [[NikC-]]

### v9.68

* Introduced ScrN Shared Library - **ScrnShared.u** that is used by all mutators.
* All ScrN mutators have the same version numbering and extended from `ScrnShared.ScrnMutator`.
  No More HMG v5, HTec v4, ZedPack v2 - all are v9.68.xx from now on.
* Make sure to update ALL Scrn*.u packages!
* Added `ScrnAchMutator` - base class for achievement-tracking mutators.
* `MUTATE VERSION` displays all ScrN mutator versions, even inactive ones (e.g., achievement trackers)
* Make sure to add those new mutators to *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*:

```cpp
AutoLoadMutators=ScrnZedPack.ZedPackMut
AutoLoadMutators=ScrnHMG.HmgMut
```

* Added `LockTeamMinWaveTourney=1.0` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* to allow locking team earlier in Tourney Mode
  (e.g., prevent some random noobs from ruining your XCM run)
* Fixed an issue where `MVOTE LOCKPERK` did not display perk name
* Fixed zed precaching on client-side. Should remove stuttering on the first appearance of a custom zed or Doom monster.
* Perk and achievement progress is not saved on a test map. Players can still gain progress (for testing) but it is not
  saved to there perk database. Works like vanilla greylisted servers.
* Achievement earning restored on a test map (for testing) - but gained achievements are not saved.
* Added `bTest` to *ScrnGames.ini*. Forces `bTestMap=true` on any map for the given game mode.
* **XCM** v0.31
* Set `FtgSpawnDelayOnPickup=10` by default.
* Zeds nailed to a wall bleed out in ~20s. That prevents an issue on some custom maps where nailed zed could stuck
  outside the map.
* Added map definition for Suburbia.

#### ScrN Voting Handler

* Partial player name search in `MVOTE <cmd> <playername>`
* Fixed an issue where vote percent did not recalculate on player leaving

### v9.67.19

#### FTG

* Zed spawns made faster
* Added `FtgSpawnRateMod` and `FtgSpawnDelayOnPickup` config options to *ScrnGames.ini* for fine-tuning.
* FTG-OTC v2.20: adjusted spawn rates and added more zeds to "Kill Remaining" waves to give more
  time for Stinky Clot to get to the trader.

#### TSC

* Deprecated `LateJoinerCashBonus` - replaced by `StartingCashBonus` and `bStartingCashRelative` in *ScrnGames.ini*
* Deprecated `OvertimeTeamMoneyPenalty` - harder waves are used in overtime instead of cutting dosh.
* Added `TSCOT` and `TSCSD` waves in *ScrnWaves.ini* for Overtime and Sudden Death respectively.
* Lowered Overtime wave count to 1 by default (down from 2). Now there are 7 normal waves + 1 OT + 1 SD.

#### ScrnGames/Waves.ini

* Added `Doom3DisableSuperMonstersFromWave` to disable Doom3 mid-game bosses on last waves before the boss.
* Doom3 mid-game boss disabled on Doom3 Wave 10 because the final wave wave is generally harder when boss is not spawned
* `MaxZombiesOnce` can be used to control end-game boss waves. If not set, the default value for RULE_KillBoss is 16.

### v9.67.18

* Fixed an issue when players started a game as dead if joined from spectators
* Added `PlayerInfoOffset` config variable to `ScrnHUD` (*ScrnUser.ini*) allowing to tweak vertical offset of player
  health bars. For example, bars can be lowered down to the ground to prevent obscuring vision.
  The config variable can be controlled via ScrN Features GUI or `BarOffset` console command.
* Fixed multiple issues in Hardcore Level calculation
* Raised XCM HL to 30 if played on HoE + Hardcore Mode
* Fixed an issue where TSC displayed "GET BACK TO THE BASE OR DIE!" even when the base loss did not result in a wipe.
* FTG displays a regular "GET BACK TO THE BASE!" message at the beginning, then switches to
  "GET BACK TO THE BASE OR DIE!" for the last 12s before the wipe. Message is displayed every 4 seconds, allowing
  players to predict the remaining time to get back to the base:
  * regular message: time left > 15s;
  * 3 die messages at 12, 8, and 4s left respectively;
  * team wipe in 4s after the 3rd die message.

### v9.67.17

* Removed HoE difficulty requirement for HoE map achievements. It still requires HL15+, therefore, players need
  add more custom zeds on Suicidal to boost HL.
* Suicidal map achievements can be earned on any custom game, included user-defined (GameLength=60+)
* Tweaked HL increase for Doom3 monsters to ensure HL15+ on HoE even if no mid-game bosses spawned.
* Enabled Tesla Husks and Shivers in FTG by default to give a HoE map achievement for winning a Suicidal game.
* Disabled Hard+ map achievements in TSC

##### Map Achievement Summary

* Normal ach is granted for winning any game (including TSC)
* Hard ach requires HL5+ and at least one custom/super/doom zed (excluding Boss)
* Suicidal ach requires HL10+ and one of the following:
  * Turbo Floor
  * Nightmare game (GameLength=9)
  * Social Isolation
  * Any custom game with GameLength >= 60
* HoE ach requires HL15+ and one of the following:
  * FTG
  * Doom3 demons
  * XCM (GameLength=7)

### v9.67.16

* Fixed a bug that preventing earning map achievements and end game bonuses
* HoE map achievement requires HoE difficulty (cannot get it on FTG/Doom3 Suicidal)
* Winning XCM grants HoE map achievement

### v9.67.15

* **XCM** moved into beta phase (v0.30)

* Random map voting allows also game and difficult selection. For example:
  `MVOTE MAP RANDOM DooM3 HoE`
* Added `RandomMapStatBonus` to *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* - allows boosting `EndGameStatBonus` when voted for a random map.
  Should encourage playing on different maps instead of BioticsLab 24/7.
* Added alias `*` for `RANDOM`. `MVM *` is the shortest way to vote for a random map.
* Typing `^` at the end of the map name selects the first match even if multiple matches detected. For example,
  `MVOTE MAP LONDON^` votes for KF-WestLondon even if KF-WestLondonNight and KF-WestLondonWinter exist on the server.
* Fixed a bug where single pistols headshot kills did not give Sharpshooter XP progress

#### ScrnMapInfo.ini

Added map definitions for the following maps:

* AbusementPark
* Aperture
* Biohazard
* HospitalHorrors (fix)
* Wyre

#### Code Changes

* Moved `BarStyleItems` and `HudStyleItems` from `ScrnTab_UserSettings` to `ScrnHUD` and renamed to `BarStyles` and
  `HudStyles` respectively. That allows custom HUD to be selected by the player via GIU with zero changes to GUI and
  without forcing selection to the custom HUD.
* `PlayerInfoVersion` command deprecated. Use `ToggleBarStyle` instead.
* `bCoolHud` and `bCoolHudLeftAlign` are not configurable anymore. Replaced with `HudStyle`.

### v9.67.14

* `MVM` - console command as a shortcut for `MVOTE MAP`
* Fixed missing smiley tags in ServerPerks
* Fixed multiple issues in  **XCM DUEL**
* Adjusted zed spawns in **FTG**
* Adjusted zed spawn rate in **FTG-OTC**.
* ScrnWaves.ini: Fixed an issue where waves with `bRandomSquads=false` doubled zed spawn rate
* Adjusted **XCM** waves to compensate the above bug fix

### v9.67.11

* New game mode: **XCM DUEL** - two players in TSC-like game try to survive as long as possible in XCM waves.
  The one who dies first, loses.
* `MVOTE DIFFICULTY` does not require map restart the match has not begun yet.
* Mid-game difficulty changes are allowed on a test map.
* TSC: During Overtime or Sudden Wave, if one team gets wiped, then other wins immediately. No need to survive until
  the end of the wave anymore. XCM DUEL has only Sudden Death waves.

### v9.67.10

* Entering the full map name in `MVOTE MAP` have selection priority over a partial match.
  For example, previously it was impossible to vote for KF-Foundry, if you the server also had KF-FoundryLightsOut
  because it selected two maps. Now, `MVOTE MAP KF-FOUNDRY` selects KF-Foundry.
* Code execution optimization. Replaced `ReplaceText()` calls with `Repl()` since the former is an UnrealScript
  function (slow) while the latter is a native one. I have no idea why Tripwire wrote `ReplaceText()` in
  UnrealScript instead of C++.

### v9.67.09

* Added `bTestMap` and `GuardianLight` to *ScrnMapInfo.ini*
* TSC/FTG: lowered default brightness of Base Guardian (but can be altered in *ScrnMapInfo.ini*)
* Achievement progress disabled on test maps, but perk changes are always allowed.
* Fixed a bug in `MVOTE ZED FP SPAWN`

#### ScrN Zed Pack

* Added *ScrnZedPack.ini* to change headshot detection on dedicated servers.
* `bHeadshotSrvAnim=false` fixes headshot detection. Set it to false for vanilla behavior (where you cannot decapitate
  a Bloat while your noobie teammates is body-spamming him)
* Reduced **Siren** Vortex Pull strength on Hard and below.
* Made **Crawlers** lighter. Now it is easier to push them. You can even stomp Crawlers to kill them.

### v9.67.08

#### ScrnMapInfo.ini

* Completely reworked the *ScrnMapInfo.ini*. Now it has per-map objects (somewhat similar to Games/Waves/Zeds).
* Zed spawning can be fine-tuned for each map via multiple config options.
* Added `DebugZedSpawn` console command which draws zombie volumes where zed spawned. Works only in Solo/Listen mode.
* Allows altering Stinky Clot paths in FTG individually for each map.
* Check the default *ScrnMapInfo.ini* for details.
* ScrnMapInfo.ini is far from complete, and have only few map definitions. Please contribute!

#### ScrnGames.ini

* Added `bAllowZedEvents` and `bDebug`
* Zed squad logging obeys `LogZedSpawnLevel` under `[ScrnBalanceSrv.ScrnGameType]` in *KillingFloor.ini*

### ScrnBalanceSrv.ini

* Added `OriginalMap` under `MapAlias` to specify the map object in *ScrnMapInfo.ini* (if it differs from `AchName`)
* `bForceEvent=True` by default but now it obeys `bAllowZedEvents` value in *ScrnGames.ini*

#### FTG

* wrote yet another workaround for Stinky Clot when he gets stuck.
* fixed an issue when Stinky Clot could get a 300uu/s speed boost while not seen by the players.
* Added `bDebugStinkyPath` config option under `[ScrnBalanceSrv.FtgGame]` in *KillingFloor.ini* to log Stinky paths

#### Bugfixes and QoL improvements

* **XCM v0.21**
* Speed up **M32** drrum close animation during reload interruption. Now it is less annoying while still realistic
  (unlike vanilla)
* ScrN Features: added a checkbox to show left pistol ammo separately (while dual-wielding)
* Fixed multiple log warnings

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Lowered **HK-417** weight to 7 (down from 8)
* Fixed warnings

#### ScrN Zed Pack

* Fixed multiple log warnings

### v9.67.07

#### Balance

* Commando now has 60% damage bonus @ Lv6 like all other perks (up from 50%)
* Commando received +50% bigger magazines for perked weapons (up from +25%)
* Removed Bullpup bullet penetration due to increased stats
* M4 magazine size restored to 30 (down from 32).
* M4 damage increased to 41 to match M4-203 primary damage.
* Regular M4 headshot multiplier lowered to x1.2 (down from x1.3)
* M4-203 price increased to $1750 (up from $1600)
* Gunslinger has lower recoil with laser pistols while laser sights are active
* Removed armor requirement for Cowboy Mode. Now Gunslinger can wear armor like all other perks.
* Lowered Demolitions discount on pipebombs. Now Demo receives -60% discount @ Lv6 like on all other weapons.
* Support Specialist carry weight lowered to 24 (down from 25). I have no idea why Support received weight buff before.
* Removed M99, CrossBuzzSaw, HRL, and RPG from Tourney Mode (unless TOURNEY_ALL_WEAPONS flag is set)

#### QoL improvements and bug fixes

* `MVOTE MAP RESTART` - restarts the current map
* `MVOTE MAP RANDOM` - votes for random map
* `MVOTE MAP WESTLONDON` - votes for specific map
* `MVOTE MAP LONDON` - short names are allowed too
* `MVOTE MAP LONDON XCM HOE` - Votes for map/game/difficulty
* `MVOTE MAP HELP` - returns available maps and game modes
* `MVOTE MAP LIST` - returns available maps
* `MVOTE MAP LIST OBJ` - returns available maps for the specified game mode. In this case, `OBJ` is an acronym for
  Objective Mode
* Added `LeftGunAmmo 1|0` console command to display left gun ammo separately in case of dual pistols.
  By default, classic mode is used - combined ammo counter.
* Restored `MVOTE BORING` for legacy games (`KFGameType`).
* Fixed an issue where `MVOTE BORING` could cause zeds to spawn further from players due to overused close volumes.
* Optimized zed spawn mechanics, achieving at least 30x better CPU usage (removing lag spikes),
  especially on map with many ZombieVolumes, like FrightYard.
* On a test map, `MUTATE ZED FP SPAWN` can be used without admin privileges
* Shotgun pellets can damage the same targets no more than twise (head + body). It fixes insane shotgun damage
  on servers with high TickRate, where shotgun pellets do damage per every tick.
* Reduced network replication of game speed during zed time exit. This should reduce lags at zed time end,
  especially on servers with high TickRate.
* Fixed warning: "PlayAnim: Sequence 'HitF_Dual9mmm' not found for mesh"
* Fixed a bug where a player did not receive burning damage after killing the Husk who set player on fire.

#### KillingFloor.ini

* Added `VotingHandlerOverride=KFMapVoteV2.KFVotingHandler` to `ScrnGameType` and `ScrnStoryGameInfo` to override map
  voting handlerr to KFMapVoteV2 by default. New players do not have to edit KillingFloor.ini to install the bundle.
* Added `LogZedSpawnLevel=2` to ScrnGameType config (KillingFloor.ini). Set it to 7 to debug zed spawns.

#### XCM v0.20

* Reworked early wave spawns
* Fixed a bug that halved zed spawn rate
* Fixed another bug that slowered bug zed squad spawns
* Lowered usage of Sucicide Timer beeps (except the last minute remaining)

#### FTG

* FTG: On The Clock game mode updated to v2.01 (by [nmmblez])
* Fixed a bug where Stinky Clot could teleport to the null point of the map (X=0,Y=0,Z=0)
* Fixed an issue where Stinky Clot could spawn too close to the players
* Log more telemetry data if Stinky Clot gets stuck

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Restored normal HS multiplier for *VAL* (x1.1, was x1.0)
* *HK-417* magazine size raised to 20 and price to $3500
* *HRL* blast radius lowered to 8m (down from 9m)
* *Saiga 12* price raised to $3000 (up from $2500)

#### ScrN Zed Pack v2.10

* HardPat does not become invulnerable anymore. Now, when clocked and escaping, he has 80% damage resistance,
  but can attack players who block him.
* Male and Female FP do not attack or push each other anymore
* Players can push Crawlers away - the latter are too small to block players
* Fixed warning about missing jump animation for crawler

### v9.67.05

* Fixed Suicide Timer being out of sync between the server and clients.
* `SUICIDE` console command triggers the suicide bomb if such exists. That can be used as a last resort to kill the
  remaining zeds via sacrificing.

### v9.67.04

* Fixed an issue when last spawned zeds can be immediately killed by the game
* XCM: Rebalanced Wave 10 and added the boss wave. Patriarch has +50% hp in XCM.
* XCM: lowered suicide timer. Solo player has 2:30 per wave; +30s per player.
* Added `GameVersion` to both ScrnGames.ini and ScrnWaves.ini for version tracking and sync validation.

### v9.67.03

* Added last two missing waves in XCM (w8 and 9)
* Balanced XCM spawns (no more BL + HU spawns)
* Fixed a bug where players spawned with achievement-related "candies" in TSC or/and Tourney

### v9.67.01

* Reduced shotgun penetration after hitting medium/big zeds.
* Fixed a bug where surviving a game with no boss lead to a loss.
* Fixed an issue where `bRandomSquads` and `bRandomSpecialSquads` were messed up with each other.
* Added `SuicideTimePerPlayerMult` in both ScrnGames.ini and ScrnWaves.ini
* Added `bMoreAmmoBoxes` to ScrnWaves.ini. Now ammo boost can be set for any wave, not only `RULE_GrabAmmo`.
* Fixed an issue where a suicide bomb counted as a regular pipebomb and could be triggered at wave start due to limit
* Added XCM Wave7 (W8 and W9 are not ready yet)

### v9.67

**WARNING! ScrnWaves.ini got split on ScrnGames.ini, ScrnZeds.ini and ScrnWaves.ini**

#### ScrnGames.ini

* TSC `NWaves`, `OTWaves`, and `SDWaves` moved from KFMapVote.ini.
* Added `MinDifficulty` and `MaxDifficulty` to limit difficulty range for the given game. For example, setting
  MinDifficulty=7 and MaxDifficulty=7 forces difficulty to HoE regardless of KFMapVote.ini or `MVOTE DIFF`
* Added `bForceTourney` and `TourneyFlags` to override Tourney Mode
* Passing `?Difficulty=` and `?Tourney=` in server cmd line or KFMapVote.ini is **unreliable and should NOT be used**.
  The game caches command line arguments and passes them from game to game even if those are not set in KFMapVote.ini.
* `bRandomTrader` - allows disabling trader randomization (does not work in TSC)
* `SuicideTime`, `SuicideTimePerWave` - attaches a pipebomb to every player that triggers in the given time.
  Forces players to finish the game/wave within the specified timelimit. This can be fine-tuned via game's

#### ScrnWaves.ini

* if `bStartAtTrader=true` but `bOpenTrader=false` players spawn at random trader. Can be used on wave 1 to spawn
  players in different places.
* `SuicideTime`, `bSuicideTimeReset` - allows fine-tuning the game's suicide timer for each wave.
* Putting `^` (keep with above) at the beginning of squad definition makes the squad always spawn after the previous
  one event if `bRandomSquads=true`. Multiple squads can be chained together. The next example always spawns Bloat,
  then two Siren after FP, and two Husks after SC. However, the game randomly picks either FP or SC to spawn first.

```cpp
Squads=FP
Squads=^ BL
Squads=^ 2*SI
Squads=SC
Squads=^ 2*HU
```

#### ScrN Brutal KF Bundle

* Excluded Workshop packages in NetReduce.ini. This should fix Xmas ammo boxes on ESL and Ice Cave.

#### FTG

* Made Stinky Clot fatter while invulnerable (green) to prevent him from falling into narrow holes

#### Social Isolation

* Disabled penalty for coughing in shop (due to multiple reports of being too annoying)

* Infected by other players have more severe symptoms than the initially infected.

#### Balance

* Gunslinger deals 50% more pistol damage to *Bloats*, allowing popping their heads as efficient as Sharpie.
* Killing a *Bloat*  with a pistol headshot gives +3 Gunslinger XP progress
* Killing a *Scrake* with a pistol headshot gives +7 Gunslinger XP progress

#### eXpert Challenge Mode (XCM)

A new game mode designed to push pro players to the limit both in individual skills and team coordination.
Work in progress. More info here:
<https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ScrNBalance/discussions/9/4580716151550023598/>

#### Hardcore Mode

* Removed `bHardcore` from ScrnBalance.ini. Hardcore Mode can be enabled via game difficulty (6 or 8).
* Non-hardcore perks are automatically disabled in Hardcore Mode
* Fixed Difficulty=6 (Siu+Hardcore) and Difficulty=8 (HoE+Hardcore) in KFMapVote.ini  (thanks to [nmmblez])
* Config option `HLMult_Hardcore` (default 15%) - extra Hardcore Level multiplier in Hardcore Mode
* Field and Combat Medics receive 50% more damage from Siren Scream (and any damage that bypasses armor)
* Support Spec. has 20% slower fire rate and receives 50% more damage from Gorefasts
* Sharpshooter deals half damage to bodies and has no reload speed bonus (except LAR).
  Receives 50% more damage from Scrakes/Jasons.
* Commando has no extra ammo bonus and receives quad damage from Stalkers
* Berserker has no damage resistance against fire (except Doom3) and moves extremely slow while holding Syringe.
* Firebug has only 50% fire damage resistance (but still immune to self fire). Receives quad damage from Clots.
* Demolitions Expert receives one extra pipebomb per two levels (max 5 pipes on lv6) and 50% explosive resistance.
  Receives 50% more damage from Fleshpounds.
* Grenades, rockets, and HuskGun projectiles do not fly through teammates in Hardcore Mode.
* Gunslinger has reduced reload speed bonus and receives double damage from Crawlers

#### ScrnUser.ini

* Moved ScrN user settings (ScrnPlayerController, ScrnHUD) from User.ini to ScrnUser.ini.
* (ScrnHUD) `PerkStarsMax` (default=30) - limits the number of perk level starts drawn on HUD
* (ScrnHUD) `bShowDamages` replaced with `ShowDamages` which has three options:
  * 0 - hides damage numbers (same as old `bShowDamages=false`)
  * 1 - combines multiple damages of the same type (e.g., shotgun pellets) and displays the total amount
  * 2 - shows all damage numbers (same as old `bShowDamages=true`)

#### Other changes

* Introduced perk short names (`ScrnVeterancyTypes.ShortName`). Type `MVOTE LOCKPERK` without arguments to display perk
  list.  You can use either perk number, short or long name to identify voted perk(-s).
* Locking/unlocking multiple perks at once. For example: `MVOTE LOCKPERK FB DEMO BER`
* Inverse perk selector by using `!`. The following command locks all perks but Sharpshooter, Commando and Gunslinger:
  `MVOTE LOCKPERK ! SHA CMD GS`
* Typing `MVOTE LOCKPERK` without arguments displays perk lists with numbers and short names.
  You can use either perk number, short or long name to identify voted perk(-s)
* Fixed glitch in MK23 and HC tactical reload animations in solo and listen server modes
* Added left pistol ammo counter to Classic HUD
* Added secondary ammo (e.g., M203) counter to Cool HUD

#### Code Changes

* `ScrnPlayerController.ClientPlayerDamaged()` made protected to prevent access from elsewhere.
  Call `DamageMade()` instead.
* Set `bHardcoreReady=true` in custom perks to make them available in Hardcore Mode

### v9.66

* Fixed a bug that could cause too high recoil during the Zed Time
* 3rd person view disabled in TSC and Tourney Mode. In addition, a new config option `bAllowBehindView`
  added to *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*.
* Reduced M99 penetration damage reduction to 5% (down from 20%)
* Increased Combat Shotgun reload rate to 0.6s per shell (from 0.75s)
* Removed Combat Shotgun spread penalty for not aiming down the sights - it has laser sights after all.

#### ScrnZedPack v2

* Added and reworked all vanilla zeds to ScrnZedPack
* Renamed most zed classes inside ScrnZedPack (check *ScrnWaves.ini*)
* Enhanced head detection
* Fixed projection of laser sights on big zed heads

###### Bloat

* Doubled head health (25 -> 50 base)
* Head health increases by 20% per extra player. 6p HoE Bloat now has 175hp
  Not too much, but cannot be decapitated with just two off-perk 9mm shots
* Bloat cannot puke while decapitated
* Decapitating a Bloat immediately stops him from vomiting

###### Siren

* Removed the scream canceling exploit
* Siren cannot scream when decapitated
* Decapitating Siren during screaming eliminates any further damage.
* Fixed vortex pull effect (it has been bugged in vanilla since the very beginning didn't work in the most cases).
* Reduced scream damage by 25% to compensate for fixed vortex pull.
* Siren scream shatters frozen zeds nearby, turning their bodies into deadly ice shards

###### Scrake

* Saw loop damage now scales per difficulty. In vanilla it did not change, that why SC did so little damage on HoE.
* Base saw loop damage reduced by 20% to compensate fixed difficulty scaling. HoE saw damage is higher by ~40% now.

#### Horzine Technician v5

* Removed Cryo Sirens because regular Sirens from ScrnZedPack can shatter frozen zeds now
* Sirens can scream just to shatter zeds in front, even when not seeing players (e.g., standing around a corner next to
  frozen zeds)
* Optimized performance of Freeze Mechanics
* Increased mag capacity bonus for ZED Guns and Cryo Thrower to 50% at level 6 (up from 35%)
* Increased Cryo Thrower total ammo to 960 (up from 840)
* Reduced ZED Gun MKII weight to 5 (down from 6), so it can be carried along with Cryo Mass Driver and Horzine Armor
* Fixed point-blank headshot detection for ice darts (the same bug as for shotguns)

### v9.65

* Perk progress calculation now takes into account possible 32-bit integer overflow. A signed 32-bit integer may store
  numbers up to ~2147M. Some players have reached such an insane XP level, which caused perk progress to appear negative
  due to overflow. Now this case is properly handled, and perk progress is capped at ~2147M. However, reaching
  ~4294M will cause the unsigned int32 overflow, and the perk level gets reset back to 0.
  [nmmblez], time to think about lowering XP bonus levels ;)
* Added a hardcoded limitation for MaxPerksLevel <= 70. Higher levels could raise requirements beyond int32 capacity.
* Adjusted level requirement numbers for all perks. Previously, getting from Lv4 to Lv6 was much harder than from Lv6
  to Lv10. It does not make sense since perk level rebalance in v9.50, when Lv5 and Lv6 stopped getting way higher
  bonuses comparing to lower levels. Now, getting the next level is always harder than the previous one; Lv6 is easier
  to reach, but lv7-11 - harder. Lv12-30 have more or less the same requirements as before; lv31+ are harder to gain.
  Lv70 has 2140M damage requirement; it is the absolute maximum to achieve, which still fits into int32.
* Perks that require lower thresholds (such as Sharpshooter or Gunslinger) are capped at Lv70 too, for consistency
  with other perks.
* Removed Stalker kill requirement for Commando. Now, all ScrN perks have one requirement.
* Stalker/Shiver kills give bonus XP to Commando: one Stalker kill = 1K damage bonus.
* Welding gives bonus XP to Support Spec.: 100 welding points = 1K damage bonus.
* Sniper damage that is high enough to stun a Scrake (>=667) gives bonus XP to Sharphooter.
  Previously, such as option could be enabled via `SharpProgMinDmg` config value. Now it is hardcoded to 667.
* Deprecated config options: `Post6RequirementScaling`, `WeldingRequirementScaling`, `StalkerRequirementScaling`,
  `SharpProgMinDmg` (*ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*)
* Purged all deprecated variable declarations from ScrnBalance.
* FTG: fixed an issue where Stinky Clot could continuously blame a player if getting stuck.
* FTG: added a workaround to get Stinky Clot out of a 3-waypoint loop path (infinitely going A=>B=>C=>A)

### v9.64.09

* FTG: Fixed an issue where a wrong player got blamed for putting the base in a glitch spot (thanks [Joe])
* If the team is locked (`MVOTE LOCKTEAM`), newcomers are put into spectators rather than appearing as dead teammates.
* Fixed an issue where Tourney Mode stayed active after loading a game config without the `?Tourney` option.
* Game config's `?Difficulty` option has higher precedence than `MVOTE DIFF`. In other words, players cannot change
  difficulty for game configs that have hardcoded difficulty option in *KFMapVote.ini*
* Fixed ScrN game hints (thanks [P-Jay]).
* By the looks of it, any config (.ini) or localization (.int) line cannot exceed 4096 characters.
* 4k limitation also applies on `GameConfig` lines in *KFMapVote.ini*. All GameConfig lines *together*
  cannot exceed 4k characters.
* Game modes "52. FTG: Fight The Patriarchs" and "83. On The Clock" removed from the standard rotation to reduce
  GameConfig size and meet the 4k limitation.

### v9.64.07

* Zeds can fight each other again (was broken since v6)
* `bTraderSpeedBoost` disabled in Story Mode
* Machete-sprinting disabled in Tourney Mode, TSC, or Story Mode.
* Max Machete-boost capped at 120 (down from 150). Now, Machete-sprinting follows 20+20+20 principle: first 20 steps
  with high boost (+3), then 20 average (+2), and small boost at the end (+1).
* Machete damage boost is applied only on the first hit after the pickup or a kill.
* Added `?Tourney=0` options to all non-tourney games modes in *KFMapVote.ini*
  It seems that unspecified options carried values from the previous maps.

### v9.64.06

* Enabled **Tactical Reload** with full mag but initially empty chamber for all closed-bolt weapons, including
  **ScrN Weapon Pack** (by [Duckbuster])
* Fixed player scream for medic on low health (it was in the vanilla code but never worked due to bugs)
* Code optimization

### v9.64.05

* Reworked zed spawn rate calculation by throwing out all the Tripwire's code into a trashcan.
  Now, the zed spawn rate increases consistently by the *alive* player count.
* Deprecated config options: `Post6ZedSpawnInc`, `Post6AmmoSpawnInc`, `Post6ZedsPerPlayer`, `bAlterWaveSize`,
  `bSpawnRateFix` (*ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*)
* `MVOTE BORING` made consistent across maps. Previously, the boring vote was scaled by the map-specific
  `WaveSpawnPeriod` value. Now, boring vote has 3 stages no matter of the map:  DOUBLE/QUAD/INSANE spawns.
* Boring vote raises the *Hardcore Level*. HL increase value depends of the game's HL and remaining zed count.
  There must be at least 100 zeds left in the wave for the boring vote to increase HL.
  HL bonus is granted at the end of the wave. A player death resets the boring value and HL bonus.
* Yet another attempt to fix the negative team dosh bug
* Made sure that a player with 100hp and 25 armor always survives one FP rage hit.
  Previously, it was RNG because FP dealt 114..128 damage on HoE. Now, FP deals 114..124 damage.
* Last survivor's self-healing gives +50hp (same as in the Solo mode)
* Modified spawn inventory (make sure to update *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*)
* Removed "Boomstick before AA12" checkbox from ScrN Features. Use gun slots instead.
* Added "No Weapon Autoswitch" checkbox to ScrN Features

#### TSC

* Fixed uneven teams balance health bonus (previously, it gave extra +100hp to the smaller team)
* Zed Squad definition in *ScrnWaves.ini* now uses the biggest team size for min/max player restriction
  instead of total player count in the game. Previously, `SpecialSquads=8: 4*FP` could spawn quad FP in 4v4 TSC game.
* Fixed an issue where Commando spawned without weapons
* Fixed inconsistent PvP damage scale. Now PvP damage always deals 10% of the damage, including damage bonuses.
  Headshot multiplier for all weapons is x2, except shotguns (x1) and sniper rifles (original, x2 at least)
* Fixed an exploit where a dead player could free roam after reconnect
* Player death charges the team for constant $100 instead of random nonsense.
* Killing a teammate transfers up to $200 from the killer to the victim
* Introduced **Tourney Mode** flags (see the default *KFMapVote.ini* for details)
* Known Issue: Damaging a Field Medic displays full damage because armor absorption takes place later in the code
* Known Issue: Flares do not damage other players

#### ScrN Waves

* Added new settings: `LaterWavePct`, `LaterWaveSpawnCooldown`, `SpecialSquadCooldown`.
  Check the default *ScrnWaves.ini* for details.
* Added a special squad "Jasons+Scrakes+Huks" for Wave 9 and 10

### v9.64.03

* Player can **interrupt reloading by throwing the weapon on the ground**
* if `bPrioritizePerkedWeapons=true` in *User.ini*, perked weapons receive a higher rating when making a decision to
  auto-switch to the newly obtained weapon or not.
* Player may set `bNeverSwitchOnPickup=true` in *User.ini* to completely prevent weapon auto-switching.
* `bNeverSwitchOnPickup=true` breaks machete-sprinting with the default drop weapon key. However, there is a workaround:
  `set input SPACE GetWeapon ScrnMachete | OnRelease ThrowWeapon`
* Slightly increased the movement speed of **Stinky Clot**. Moreover, speed now scales by the game difficulty.
* Fixed Stinky Clot's head hitbox.
* Fixed yet another navigation bug that could cause Stinky Clot to get stuck.
* Stinky Clot does not move to the trader during the boss wave or if the trader will be closed for the next wave.

### v9.64.01

* Ready and View Map buttons switch places so the ready button is at the same position as in the vanilla game.
* Fixed a bug that could prevent ammo boxes from respawning
* Changed how Medic's "better" armor behaves. Previously, medic armor blindly reduced all incoming damage by 60%
  (vanilla - by 75%).
  For instance, HoE FP may deal 120 damage. Medic with just 1% armor reduced the incoming damage to 120 - 60% = 48.
  **Now, medic armor reduces damage by up to double amount of its armor points**.
  So having 1% armor removes only 2hp damage; 10% - up to 20hp;
  to fully reduce FP 120hp attack by 60% (72hp), medic needs at least 36AP.
* `KFVeterancyTypes.GetBodyArmorDamageModifier()` deprecated.
  `ScrnVeterancyTypes.ShieldReduceDamage()` used instead.

#### TSC

* The default key for the base setup moved from AltFire to `Duck` / `Crouch`. Players still can set the dedicated
  key for base setup, e.g.: `set input B SetupBase`, `set input X DropFlag`
* Fixed an issue when switching from TSC to FTG kept the `NWaves` option (wave count) from the previous game
* Disabled free roam camera for dead players
* Stunned Base Guardians wake up on a wave start.
* Stun time: 30s, wakeup duration: 10s.
* The Base Guardian cannot be damaged/stunned while waking up or during the first 10s of a wave.
* Increased the light radius of Base Guardians to cover almost the entire base while guarding.
* Combat Medic does not get armor protection bonus from human damage.
* Lowered Field Medic armor protection bonus from human damage to 30% (down from 40%).
* Combat Medic cannot see enemy health bars. Only Field Medic can see those.
* Fixed health balance of uneven teams. Both teams should have the same total amount of health points.
  For instance, When playing 4v5, members of the 4p team will have 125hp (4x125 = 5x100)

#### ScrN Waves

* New game mode: **42. TSC Tourney**
* Game mode **51. FTG: On The Clock** replaced with the new version (by [nmmblez])
* Added `TraderSpeedBoost` to `ScrnGameLength` config (*ScrnWaves.ini*) to allow per-game trader speed boost control.
* Fixed an issue when sometimes dead players might respawn despite `bRespawnDeadPlayers=false` for the current wave.
* Fixed an issue where `RULE_GrabAmmo` did not spawn enough ammo boxes on the map with a low ammo box count.

### v9.64

#### Gunslinger

* Dual HC, .44, and MK23: Alt fire switches between single and dual pistols
* Cool HUD displays ammo counters separately for left and right guns.
* Dual HC, .44, and MK23 moved to slot 3 by default (previously, only GS had it in slot 3)
* Removed extra reload speed bonus for Cowboy Mode due to tactical reloads.
* The Standard reload speed bonus for revolvers increased to 100% (up from 60%) to compensate for the lack of tactical reload.
* Added 60% fire rate bonus for Colt Python (ScrN Weapon Pack)
* Dual-9mm: fixed recoil
* Dual-MK23: Fixed a bug that gave +2 ammo for
* Dual-44: if one of the revolvers is full, then reload only the other one
* Fixed bug in toggling Cowboy Mode on picking up or losing armor.
* Buying a second pistol adds initial ammo too
* Lowered initial ammo for pistols to 5 magazines
* Gunslinger ammo bonus is now an extra magazine (1/12 or ~8.33%) per level (down from 10%).
* Fixed a bug when Dual Laser Pistols prevented picking up a first aid kit

#### Money Balance

* Weapon prices are rounded up after applying the perk discount. It turns fancy prices, such as $299, into more straightforward $300
* Lowered .44 ammo price to $10 (down from $11).
* Downgrading armor is for free if the player's current armor >= max armor of the downgraded class.
  For example, you can downgrade Combat Armor to Jacket armor for free if your current armor >= 25.
  If armor < 25, then a full purchase ($100) must be made.

#### Shop

* Trying to sell the armor actually causes buying an Armored Jacket (25 armor). Now you can easily downgrade to or
  buy an Armored Jacket buy "selling" armor - double click or press BACKSPACE on the selected armor in your inventory.
* Pressing ENTER key on a player inventory item fills full ammo (for a weapon) or repairs the armor.
* Pressing F7 fills armor.
* Fixed a bug when selling weapons with BACKSPACE did not work if the mouse cursor was outside of the inventory list

### v9.63.21

* Shop: Selecting the armor item on the left side automatically opens the armor category on the right side.
  That allows easy upgrading/downgrading the armor type (Jacket/Combar/Horzine).
  Armor category is a weapon category that contains at least two armor items.
  See `WeaponCategories` in *ServerPerks.ini*
* Shop: Fixed a minor issue where damage type and headshot checkboxes were displayed for armor items.
* Lobby: the Disconnect button moved to the left side of the screen.

### v9.63.20

#### Weapon Balance

* Fixed **Point-Blank Headshot Detection** bug for all grenades, rockets, flares, Husk Gun and Trenchgun
* Fixed aiming of Husk Gun and Flare Revolver. Now the projectiles should fly where the iron sights point at
* **Trenchgun** weight lowered to 6 (down from 8)
* Lowered **MAC10** recoil
* `SkippedTradeTimeMult` default value lowered down to 0.75 (down from 1.00)
  meaning that only 75% of the skipped trader time gets transferred to the next wave
* `bDoubleDoT` deprecated because it was causing unnecessary flinching and messed up hitboxes even more than usual.
  **Smart DoT** is introduced instead. Under normal conditions, Smart DoT deals burn damage once per second.
  However, if the burn victim is about to die, Smart DoT kills it ASAP instead of waiting for the next second.
  For example, a Crawler with 60hp left is set on fire, burn DPS = 50. Standard DoT mechanics would kill the Crawler
  in two seconds: leaving it with 10hp in the first second, then overkilling it in the second.
  The Deprecated Double DoT would kill the Crawler in 1.5s.
  Smart DoT kills it in 1.2s: 60hp / 50hp/s = 1.2s.
* Continuous hits with incendiary bullets crispify zeds faster
* It is harder to re-crispify zed (apply panic to already crispy zed)
* Continuous hits with low-damage fire weapons can keep the high-damage DoT.

#### Social Isolation

* Removed restriction for infected persons to share dosh. Infected weapons still cannot be picked up by others.
* The penalty for coughing inside a shop gets charged only if there are other players in the shop that are potentially
  healthy (have no visual symptoms). That should motivate the infected players to do shopping separately from the
  healthy ones.
* Coughing penalty reduced down to $50. In addition, the coughing player gets thrown out of the shop.

### v9.63.16

#### Weapon Balance

##### FN FAL

* Restored vanilla fire rate, spread and recoil
* Reduced base damage to 55 (down from 65)
* Raised headshot multiplier to x1.75 (up from x1.30)
* Loaded with armor-piercing rounds (7.62x51mm NATO AP).
* Fleshpounds have lower damage resistance: 25% instead of standard 50%.
* Increased ammo price: $18 -> $25 per magazine.
* Removed single fire mode. Now there are two modes left: full auto and 2-bullet fixed-burst mode.
* "Brutally SCAR'd" achievement can be unlocked with FN FAL too.

##### Gunslinger

* **Magnum .44** headshot multiplier raised to x1.30 (up from x1.20)
* Shooting with 9mm pistol(-s) does not affect movement anymore

#### Spawn Balance

* Adjusted spawn inventory. Make sure to update *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*.

#### ScrN Waves

* Fixed missing Ghosts in game "83. On The Clock". Make sure to update *ScrnWaves.ini*.

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Nerfed **AK12** reload speed from 3.0/2.0s to 3.6/2.5s (full/tactical)
* **HK417** loaded with armor-piercing rounds (7.62x51mm NATO AP):
  * Headshot multiplier raised to x1.75 (ip from x1.30)
  * Lowered base damage to 80 (down from 85)
  * Reduced Fleshpound damage resistance (50% -> 25%)
  * Up to 4 over-penetrations
* **HK417** magazines made slightly bigger: 15/18 -> 16/20 (base/lv6 Commando)
* **SVD** total ammo increased to 90 (up from 80) due to its heavy weight
  (weight of the inventory item = gun weight + ammo weight)
* Explained the big weight difference between SVD (11kg) and SVDS (7kg) in the item description:
  * SVD is loaded with special sniper rounds 7N1 while SVDS is loaded with regular 7.62x54mmR
  * SVD has 50% more total ammo comparing to SVDS
  * SVDS uses Horzine custom light-weight 5-round magazines
  * The original reason was (and is) "because of the balance"
* **VAL** cost lowered to $2500 (down from $3500) but significantly raised ammo cost
* **VAL** total ammo count raised to 300 (up from 260)
* Fixed "Flarry Men" achievement

### v9.63.15

* **Support Spec.** gains 40% damage resistance while holding a **Chainsaw**
* Revised game hints
* Adjusted spawn inventory and some custom game waves. Make sure to update *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* and *ScrnWaves.ini*.

### v9.63.12

* **Nailgun** primary fire shoots single nails while the secondary fire - 7-nail pack (thanks [Duckbuster])
* Changed achievement progress display priority: achievements with lower goal value have higher priority to be displayed
* Social Isolation: fixed penalty for coughing in shop

### v9.63.11

* Fixed a crash on weapon pickup
* Sharpshooter damage bonus with 9mm pistol restored to 40%

### v9.63.10

#### Weapon Balance

* **Handcannon** magazine size reduced down to 7 bullets (+1 in case of a tactical reload)
* **Sharpshooter** gains only 30% faster reload with single pistols, M14, and Musket (down from 60%).
    Reload speed bonus reduce compensates a tactical reload buff.
* LAR and custom sniper rifles (perked weapons) still have 60% faster reload bonus
* Zeds, nailed to a wall with **Nailgun**, receive additional damage on tearing away.
* Player weapon lock applies on spawn invetory too.
* Fixed a bug that allowed a player with full Machete-boost do up to 8K damage (thanks [Joe])

#### Social Isolation

The most used strategy in Social Isolation is "Covidiot Party," i.e., do not care about distance and rely on the medic to heal you (like in real life too ;)).
Made a few changes to make being sick less "pleasant":

* Coughing on already sick players make them coughing more
* Coughing is the shop leads to -$99 penalty for disinfection needs
* Players cannot pick up infected weapons or dosh, even if they are infected too

### v9.63.09

* Players do not spawn with TP in regular games anymore (excluding *Social Isolation*)
* There is no TP in ammo boxes anymore
* New config option `bBlameFart` allows to disable farts

### v9.63.08

* Fixed an exploit that allowed throwing nades at insane rate
* **Claymore** weight raised to 8 (up from 6)
* **Chainsaw** weight lowered to 7 (down from 8)
* **Scythe** primary attack made wider (the widest attack in the Berserker's arsenal);
    secondary attack range made longer (the longest melee range).
    Neither of the attacks can stun Scrakes.
* **Scythe** price raised to 1750 (up from 1500)
* Code cleanup: removed log messages from ScrN Features tab

### v9.63.07

* Machete Boost capped at 150 (down from 250)
* Machete damage scales exponentially according to the boost and player's velocity.
* At the beginning of the wave, weapons on the ground are not destroyed immediately, but in 3 seconds.

### v9.63.06

* Added a safety check to restore weapons in case player gets stuck in `QuickMelee`.
  It should trigger automatically. If not, there is a console command: `FixQuickMelee`
  Now using QuickMelee should be safe.
* QuickMelee is now performed slightly faster
* Machete-sprint speed boost now gets halved every second instead of instantly dropping down to 0, in case of cooldown.

### v9.63.05

* Fixed reloading of the regular Shotgun
* Added more ScrN key bindings to Settings/Controls

### v9.63.04

* Fixed Shotgun headshot detection bug at point-blank range

### v9.63.03

* Fixed **Boomstick** network replication bug (some of many)
* Lowered Boomstick total ammo count from 48 down to 42 (62 -> 54 @ L6)
* Ammo box gives 6 Boomstick shells (down from 10)

#### ScrN Voting Handler v4.06

* Fixed a potential player crash issue
* Fixed an alignment issue when vote value contains color tags

### v9.63.02

#### Weapons

* Reworked **Boomstick** reload. No the reload has 3 phases: open barrels; insert shells; close barrels. Player can
  skip the reload by switching to another gun, throwing nades or Quick Melee in the first and the last phase.
  Reload cannot be skipped in the middle of inserting shells.
  Skipping reload in the phase 1 leaves the weapon unloaded. Next time Boomstick is equipped, the reload gets restarted
  from the beginning.
* Fixed the **Shotgun point-blank penetration bug** that existed from both in ScrN Balance and Vanilla since the very
  beginning. When shooting a zed at point-blank range, pellets did not penetrate the target.
  **This is not the distant spawn bug** where pellets spawn behind the target (and that's why you have to crouch or
  jump when shooting SC, for instance). The latter is still in the game. I can easily fix that but it will break all
  known combos, so I leave it as is.
* **Chainsaw** is now a cross-perk weapon (Berserker + Support Spec.)
* Raised Chainsaw alt fire headshot multiplier to x1.3 (up from x1.2)
* New achievement: *Evil Dead Combo* - Solo-kill 15 Scrakes with Chainsaw + Boomstick without taking damage.

#### Heavy MachineGunner v5.10

From now on, HMG is considered long-range Support.

* Removed ~Heavy AK47~. *Heavy Tommy Gun* is now starting Tier 1 weapon for HMG.
* Significantly raised bullet over-penetration for **RPK47**, **PKM**, and **M249**.
* Added Semi-auto mode for M249 with even higher penetration.
* Lowered M249 DPS and magazine size by ~20% to compensate increased penetration
* Lowered total ammo for RPK47, PKM, and M249.
* Increased M249 weight to 13 (up from 12)
* Lowered **Pat Chaingun** total ammo to 1500 (down from 1800)
* Raised **XMV850** damage from 39 to 45 (62 -> 72 @ L6)

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Fixed *Shotgun point-blank penetration bug* for **Saiga-12** and **SPAS-12**

#### Weapon Blame

Some weapons are considered overpowered, but nerfing them would make them useless. That's why you players can still buy
such weapons, but they get automatically blamed for doing that.
In addition to blame, *Hardcore Level* gets lowered, which, in turn, can prevent players to gain some achievements.
Blaming is done only when buying weapon from The Trader. Picking up those weapons from the ground doesn't blame the
player, neither lowers HL.

The current blame weapon list (applied only on the Boss wave - you can safely buy then in early waves):

* M99 (-1 HL)
* RPG (-4 HL)
* M41A a.k.a. Alien Rifle (-2 HL)

#### Code Changes

* Fixed an issue where spawned `ScrnGameRulesMod` didn't automatically add itself to the mod list.

### v9.63

#### Console Commands

* `WeaponSlot X` / `GunSlot X` moves weapon to slot X, where X is in [1..9] (thanks to [Scuddles])

  Players can bind extra slots like this:

```cpp
set input 6 SwitchWeapon 6
set input NumPad6 WeaponSlot 6
```

  For example, select Boomstick and press NumPad6. Boomstick gets moved from default slot 4 to slot 6.
  Now pressing 6 selects Boostick while leaving slot 4 exclusively for AA12.

#### Ridiculous Stuff

* When player is out of nades, he/she throws toilet paper
* Player drops toilet paper on death
* When blamed, the player farts and "craps out" some toilet paper
* Zeds try to avoid farts for 15 seconds
* Farting limited to once per minute to avoid cheating

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Removed the old RPG-7. Renamed the new RPG-7 from `ScrnRPG` to `RPG`.
  Make sure to update *ScrnBalanceServ.ini* and *ServerPerks.ini* to ensure that there is `RPG` and `RPGPickup`
  instead of ~ScrnRPG~ and ~ScrnRPGPickup~ respectively.
* Fixed RPG scope. Now crosshair in the scope matches the iron sights.
* Added Lidar sensor to **RPG**, calculating the distance of the target.
  Currently, the distance is displayed only on the Texture scope.

#### ScrN Zed Pack

* Fixed an issue when **Shiver** could teleport if he did not see the player.
* Added slight randomness in Shiver's teleport cooldown preventing 4-pack squad to teleport at the same time

#### Heavy MachineGunner v5.03

* Rebuilt to comply with the ScrN Balance v9.63

#### Horzine Technician v4.03

* Rebuilt to comply with the ScrN Balance v9.63

#### Code Changes

* Introduced `ScrnGameRulesMod` to allow customization of `ScrnGameRules`
* Introduced `ScrnAchHandlerBase.ApplyGameRules()` to execute once the game rules are found and set
* `ScrnAchCtrl.FindAchievement()` and therefore `ProgressAchievementByID()`, `GetAchievementByID()`, and
  `IsAchievementUnlocked()` are no longer looking for *map* achievements.
  This gives significant performance boost due to excluding 200+ map achievements from the lookup list.
  Use `ScrnMapAchievements.UnlockMapAchievement()` to unlock map achievements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### v9.62.07

#### Social Isolation

* The Virus cannot instantly kill a player with 100hp anymore

### v9.62.06

#### Social Isolation

### v9.62.05

#### Social Isolation

* Minimum player count for *Covidiot Party* achievement lowered to 3 (down from 4)
* Fixed an issue where Covidiot achievements were not given if the last infected player was asymptomatic.

#### UI/UX

* *Cool HUD* is disabled by default. New players start with the classic HUD. Cool HUD is still available for selection
  in *ScrN Features* or via console command: `ToggleHudStyle`
* Perked weapon category gets automatically selected and opened on entering shop menu

#### Balance

* Fixed an issue at zed's enemy selection where the zed could see a player behind.
* `bSpawn0` enabled by default (spawn weapons cost nothing, drop all purchased guns on death)

#### Config

* `bUseDLCLocks` disabled by default (all weapons available)
* `DLCLocks` moved to a separate config file: **ScrnLock.ini**
* All default configs converted from UTF-16 to ANSI. Any unicode characters removed.
  Keep in mind that **KF1 engine does NOT support UTF-8**.
  If you put any unicode character in the config, save it in *UTF-16 LE* encoding.
  Saving config in UTF-8 makes it unreadable by the engine.

#### Code Changes

* Removed broken achievement lookup cache
* Added `ScrnVeterancyTypes.RelatedPerkIndex` to identify related perks (e.g., Field and Combat medics)
* Fixed an incorrect player count value at `ScrnPlayerInfo.WaveStarted()`
* Fixed a warning on accessing null `KFGRI` in `ScrnBalance.PostBeginPlay()`

### v9.62.01

#### Social Isolation Mod

[Steam Webpage](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ScrNBalance/discussions/2/4666237625653274273/)

#### ScrN Waves

* New game **60 - Social Isolation**
* New game **61 - Triple Invasion** (Social Isolation + Doom3)
* Fixed an issue when event boss could spawn in non-event games
* Raised Hardcore Level for *Mystery Game*, *Welding Floor*, and *Ammo Hunt*

#### Balance Changes

* Lowered base price of **MP7M** to 350 and removed perk discount

#### Achievements

* Optimized achievement lookup speed.
* Lowered requirement for *TeamWork: Grilled Shiver Brains* to 50 (down from 250)

#### Code Changes

* Refactored achievement progress handling. All related functions moved to `ScrnAchCtrl` class.
  From now on, custom mutators should use `class'ScrnAchCtrl'.static.RegisterAchievements()` for custom achievement
  registration.
  Legacy functions left in `ScrnAchievements` class but marked deprecated. They will be removed in future.
* Added `ScrnAchHandlerBase.GameEnded()`
* Added `ScrnHumanPawn.bServerShopping` flag that is set during shopping. For example, this flag can be used to
  distinguish weapon purchase from pickup.
* Deprecated `ScrnPlayerInfo.CustomReplicationInfo`

### v9.62.00

#### Features

* Added a proper support for headshot multiplier below 1.
  For instance, if `HeadShotDamageMult=0.3`, then 30% damage goes to the head, the remaining 70% damage the body.

#### ScrN Waves

* `Doom3DisableSuperMonsters` for *ScrnGameLength*. if true, prevents Doom3Mutator from randomly spawning mid-game
  bosses. Use this, if bosses are controlled via ScrnWaves.ini. Requires **ScrnDoom3KF v9.62+**

#### Bug Fix

* Fixed a rare crash due to missing ambient sound for **xbow** and **M99**.

#### Console Commands

* `MUTATE ZED <alias> <index> SPAWN <count>` spawns zed(-s). Requires admin rights.
  Only zeds that are enabled for the current game can be spawned.
  Example: `MUTATE ZED FP 1 SPAWN 5` - spawns 5 Fleshpounds.
* `MUTATE ZED <alias> <index> SUMMON` - similar to spawn, but instead of spawning zed in a *ZombieVolume*, summons it
  in front of the player. Player needs to look at the ground where he wants to summon a zed.
  **WARNING!** Be extremely cautious when summoning a zed. If you miss the ground, you can summon it outside of the
  map and screw up the entire game. Use summon for debug/test purpose only. `SPAWN` is much safer than `SUMMON`.

#### Code Changes

* Added `MaxHeadHealth` to `ScrnGameRules.MonsterInfo`
* `ScrnFire` base class for instant fire with bullet penetration
* `ScrnHighROFFire` base class for super-fast shooting weapons

#### Heavy MachineGunner v5.00

* Fixed Stinger fire sounds
* Adjusted Stinger 1st person muzzle flash
* Fixed Pat Chaingun bullet tracer
* AUG A1 weight lowered to 8 (down from 9)

* Added bullet penetration for RPK47, PKM, and M249

  Nightmare Mode (GameLength=9) or any non-Doom non-FTG custom game modes (GameLength in [72..99])
* Fixed bug where MVOTE DIFF sometimes did not work
* Restored `bOtherPlayerLasersBlue` feature. It is not available in GUI yet, but it can be set in *User.ini*

  HardcoreLevel=(HL=10)
  HardcoreLevel=(Difficulty=5,HL=15)
  HardcoreLevel=(Difficulty=7,HL=20)

* Added random waves, e.g., `Waves=Wave2a|Wave2b|Wave2c`
* Added `Mutators` to ScrnGameLength.

#### Mutators

From now on, in most cases there is no need to specify any mutators in server command line or KFMapVote.ini.
Any ScrN game type automatically loads ScrnBalance mutator, which in turn loads ServerPerksMut.
Then ScrnBalance loads all mutators listed in `AutoLoadMutators` array (ScrnBalance.ini).
And finally `ScrnGameLength.Mutators` are loaded.

###### Mutator load order (if ScrnBalance is NOT in the server command line)

1. Mutators from the command line (KFMapVote.ini)
2. ServerPerks (`ScrnBalance.ServerPerksPkgName`, default `ScrnSP.ServerPerksMutSE`)
3. `ScrnBalance.AutoLoadMutators`
4. ScrnBalance itself
5. `ScrnGameLength.Mutators`

###### Mutator load order (if ScrnBalance is in the server command line)

1. Mutators from the command line prior to ScrnBalance.
2. ServerPerks (`ScrnBalance.ServerPerksPkgName`, default `ScrnSP.ServerPerksMutSE`)
3. `ScrnBalance.AutoLoadMutators`
4. ScrnBalance itself
5. Mutators from the command line after ScrnBalance
6. `ScrnGameLength.Mutators`

### v9.60.0

#### Version Numbering Change

Version numbering changed to **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**. No more special BETA releases.
From now on every version is a potential release candidate.

#### Burning Mechanism

* Now flares do not explode. They burn the victim from inside.
* Since regular fire damage burn zeds from outside, both can co-exist, dealing two damages at once:
  burn and flare (iDoT)
* Flares cannot crispify zeds.
* Headshots with flares do increased burn damage (iDoT) comparing to body shots.
* *Flare Revolvers* do x1.5 headshot burn damage; *Protecta* - x3.0.
* Husk Gun's headshot multiplier raised to x2.4 (up from x2.2)
* Optimized and enhanced Flare Cloud replication.
* Added `ScrnDamTypeFlare` with options to adjust flare burning behavior.

#### Gunslinger

* Added *LAR* and *Flare Revolvers* to Gunslinger's arsenal. They are cross-perk weapons now.
* LAR and Flare Revolvers kills added to Gunslinger perk progress, but only when played as Gunslinger.
* LAR headshots are still added to Sharpshooter progress no matter of perk played.
* Flare Revolver fire damage is still added to Firebug progress no matter of perk played.

#### Other changes

* `mvote FAKEDCOUNT` and `mvote FAKEDHEALTH` - allow voting to change respectively zed count and zed health.
* `mvote FAKED` is still valid and change both count and health at once.
* Fixed bug when sometimes players got negative dosh at the end of a wave
* Fixed bug in `KillRemainingZeds()` that sometimes didn't kill the remaining zeds.
* Completely removed `CustomEvents`

### v9.54

* Another attempt to fix QuickMelee bug when the player ends up with empty hands
* Modified ScrnWaves.ini to match *ScrN Brutal KF Bundle*

### v9.53

#### Code Remarks

v9.53 code is the same as v9.52's. The only change it does is **change whitespace from tabs to 4 spaces** to apply
the same standard for the entire source code.

Those who forked the *KF-ScrnBalance* repository should do the following procedure to avoid merge conflicts:

1. Merge `v9.52` **tag** into your branch.
2. Replace tabs with 4 spaces within your code ("\t" -> "    ") and commit changes to your branch.
3. Merge `v9.53` **tag** into your branch. Resolve any conflicts.
4. Merge `master` into your branch.

### v9.52

#### ScrN Waves

###### Ammo Grab Waves

Set `EndRule=RULE_GrabAmmo` to force players looking for ammo boxes. Wave ends when the given amount of ammo boxes are
picked up. Useful to make players replenish their ammo pools without opening the trader.

###### Dosh Grab Waves

Dead zeds drop dosh on the ground instead of adding it to player/team wallet. It is like using _ScrnDoshGrab_ mutator
but those could be only a few waves instead of the entire game. Wave ends when the given amount of dosh is collected.
There are two wave kinds: `RULE_DoshGrab` and `RULE_GrabDoshZed`. The difference between those two is that in
`RULE_GrabDoshZed` **zeds can pick dosh** to heal or boost their health (up to x5 of the original hp).

Dosh drop kind depends from the kill shot:

* Dosh is tossed toward player if killed by a headshot;
* Dosh is thrown up if killed by fire, explosive and other damages that can't do headshots;
* Dosh is "farted out" if killed by bodyshot.

###### Squad Scale

Added "Scale squad members by player count" feature (*Squad Scale*) to squad definition in `ScrnWaveInfo`.
For example, `SpecialSquads=~6: BOSS` means an extra boss will be added for each 6 players starting with 7th (6+1);
health of the **entire squad** will be matched to player count instead of every zed:

* 1 player : 1 boss, 1p hp
* 2 players: 1 boss, 2p hp
* 6 players: 1 boss, 6p hp
* 7 players: 2 bosses, 3.5p hp each
* 8 players: 2 bosses, 4p hp each
* 9 players: 2 bosses, 4.5p hp each
* 10 players: 2 bosses, 5p hp each
* 11 players: 2 bosses, 5.5p hp each
* 12 players: 2 bosses, 6p hp each
* 13 players: 3 bosses, 4.33p hp each (13/3)
* 18 players: 3 bosses, 6p hp each
* 20 players: 4 bosses, 3.33p hp each

*Squad Scale* can be applied for regular squads as well, e.g. `Squad=~3: SC` spawns an extra Scrake
per each 3 players in the team (every Scrake in this case won't have more than 3p health).

###### Other changes

* `BountyScale` now is applied on both player reward and team budget (previously it was applied only on team budget)
* `BountyScale`, in addition, can be set for each wave (overrides game's value)
* Inverted `SpawnRateMod`setting to avoid further confusion. From now on `SpawnRateMod=2.0` means twice *faster* spawns
  while `SpawnRateMod=0.5` - twice *slower*. **Make sure to update ScrnWaves.ini !**
* `bRandomSquads` and `bRandomSpecialSquads` - allows turning off a random component for more predictable game.
* `GameTitle` - games (ScrnGameLength) can have a name now (shown on the scoreboard)

#### TSC: Team Survival Competition

* Killing members of the other team gives $+100
* Killing teammates charges $-100

#### FTG: Follow The Guardian

* The Stinky Clot got raped by a Shiver and now gained an ability to teleport... when stuck

#### Mystery Game

* Wave2, Earn Dosh, split on three: Earn Dosh, Grab Dosh and Zed Grab Dosh.
* Added Ammo Grab wave between Wave 9 and Wave 10.
* Now there are 13 waves in the Mystery Game.
* Balance improvements.

#### (**New**) Half-Long Game

Five-wave game containing 4 latest waves from the Long game and new brand-new introduction wave (Dosh Grab)

#### (**New**) Small Big Zeds

Six-wave game where Big zeds (Husk+) have less health, but there are bigger in numbers. For example, in 6-player
Small Big Zeds game there will be 3 Scrake spawning (each having 2p health) instead of one with 6p health, unlike
in regular game.

#### Bug Fixes

* Yet another attempt to fix client crash while opening ScrN Features tab...
* Fixed Dual Flare Revolver ammo price

* **CHEAT** `DebugZedHealth TRUE` - shows zed body & head healths (only in Solo Mode!)

#### Code Remarks

* Reward for killing zed now is calculated from `Monster.ScoringValue` instead of `Monster.default.ScoringValue`.
  This allows customizing rewards per individual zed instead of zed type.
* Added `ScrnGameType.bZedTimeEnabled` flag. This allows custom mutators to disable Zed Time in the game.
* Class `Doom3MonstersCollection` is deleted. `CustomEvents` are no longer supported.

difficulty is considered easy, Hard - Normal, Suicidal - Hard, Hell on Earth - the game it meant to

    value. Entering value (e.g. MUTATE MAPZEDS 64) sets value, stores it in ScrnMapInfo.ini
    and applies it on-the-fly.
* `TestQuickMelee` - prints weapon states for debug purposes (in case QuickMelee bugs out again).

#### CONFIG VARIABLES (ScrnBalance.ini)

`bRespawnDoors` - controls door respawning at the end of the wave. By default it
    is false, i.e. if door breaks, then it's gone forever.

* Thrown dosh now stays for 2 minutes. This doesn't affect Frozen Dosh or DoshGrab mutator.
* Medic Gun damage gives Medic XP (3%, i.e. 1000 damage gives +30XP).

  If any player gets killed by a zed, then medic damage xp for that wave is halved for all players.

* Server-defined Hardcore Levels (see ScrnBalance.ini)

#### ScrnGameType (ScrN Floor)

* Assign the following command to a key for melee bash: "Button bAltFire | QuickMelee"

    SET INPUT Mouse4 Button bAltFire | QuickMelee

## Gunslinger PERK

New perk supposed to use pistols, especially in Dual mode.
To enable Gunslinger perk you need to add it to the _ServerPerks.ini_.

_"Buying perked duals -> selling offperk"_ exploit fully fixed only in the
ScrN versions of the pistols.

Single pistols are still better in Sharpshooter hands, because he has both base
and perk headshot damage multiplier (up to 140% bonus for level 6).
Gunslinger has only up to 50% damage bonus, but it's applied to the bodyshots
too. Both single and dual 9mm damage bonus is limited to 35%.

Dual pistols are no longer Sharpshooter weapons - he can't level up with them
and doesn't have any damage/reload/recoil bonuses. However, trader discount
bonus is still applied to prohibit potential buying/selling exploits.

Weight modifications were made:

```txt
Dual-9mm        2 blocks
44 Magnum       3 blocks
Dual 44 Magnum  4 blocks
HandCannon      4 blocks
Dual HC         5 blocks
Laser 44 Magnum 5 blocks (new weapon)
```

Because all Gunslinger perk inventory is light-weight, his max carry weight
is limited to 10.

Magnum44 ammo price lowered from 13 to 12 to match HC per-bullet price.
Magnum44 bullet now is slightly cheaper than HC and that is how it's supposed to be.

Dual HC/44 are put in Gunslinger's weapon slot 3. Other perks still will
have them in slot 2. This is made because usually Gunslinger has too many
pistols in slot 2 and it is compilated to switch between them.

### COWBOY MODE

Starting from level 3 Gunslinger can act in Cowboy mode.
Cowboys use only dual pistols, can't wear armor or use laser sights.
Cowboy mode is switching automatically when all the requirements are met.

Cowboy mode grants Gunslinger following bonuses:

* 25% extra reload bonus for each level (up to 75%)
* 5% speed bonus for each next level (up to 20%)
* 10% fire rate bonus for each next level (up to 30%)
