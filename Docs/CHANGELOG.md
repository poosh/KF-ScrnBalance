# Version History

> In this document all references to config file **ScrnBalance.ini** should be
  treated as **ScrnBalanceSrv.ini**, if you're using server version of
  ScrnBalance (ScrnBalanceSrv.ScrnBalance).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## VERSION 9

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### v9.69.10 - POST-MORTEM UPDATE

#### Balance
- **Combat Medic** received 30% healing and 50% syringe recharge bonus. Still far worse healing than Field Medic but at least now it is better than off-perk.
- **Katana** restored the vanilla attack speed. Previously, ScrN Katana's Primary Attack was slightly slower.
- **Commando** lost 25% ammo bonus. Base ammo pools readjusted to compensate for the bonus loss.
- **M4-203** marked as a cross-perk weapon (Demo/Commando)
- **M4** received Armor-Piercing rounds.
- All assault rifles with Armor-Piercing rounds received "AP" prefix in their names: "M4 AP", "FN FAL AP", "HK417 AP".
- **FN FAL** price raised to $4000 (up from $2750)
- Significantly raised Armor-Piercing ammo price: $30/mag for M4, $35/mag for FN FAL and HK417.
- Removed **Combat Shotgun** weird "feature" that sometimes dealt 10x damage when shot through Siren Scream.
- Reduced **Flare iDoT** damage progression. Previously, each subsequent flare dealt -25% damage. Now: -33%.

#### Games
- **FTG OTC** v2.41
- Fixed a bug where the remaining zed count got doubled at the wave begin if `bOpenTrader=false`
- Added map info for Transit, HillBillyHorror, SteamLand, Forgotten, Filthscross, and HellRide (by [nmmblez])

#### Code Changes
- Moved utility functions from `ScrnBalance` to `ScrnFunctions` class (by [NikC-])
- Removed hardcoded package names everywhere in the code (by [NikC-])

#### Other Changes
- Voice Messages are not sent to the enemy team in TSC
- Support/Medic! voice message (v11) displays health % of the sender.
- Hidden achievements do not show unless unlocked (e.g., "TSC Tourney Member"). Now hidden achievements do not prevent 100% achievement earn.
- Fixed HUD-related log warnings in Objective Mode.
- Temporarily removed auto-blame for buying OP weapons before the Boss Wave. The feature wasn't intuitive as the players didn't know they shouldn't buy those weapons beforehand.
- Added health bar to spectated player (thanks [ImmortalNub])

#### ScrN Weapon Pack
- Adjusted assault rifle ammo count to compensate for Commando's ammo bonus removal. Keep in mind that "A" custom weapon bonus still adds bonus ammo, so that's should be removed:
```
PerkedWeapons=3:ScrnWeaponPack.CZ805M:$WP
PerkedWeapons=3:ScrnWeaponPack.AKC74AssaultRifle:$WP
PerkedWeapons=3:ScrnWeaponPack.AK12AssaultRifle:$WP
PerkedWeapons=3:ScrnWeaponPack.VALDTAssaultRifle:$WP
PerkedWeapons=3:ScrnWeaponPack.HK417AR:$WP
```
- **AK-74** renamed to **AKS-74** to comply with the weapon model.
- **AKS-74** made a Tier-1 weapon: lowered damage to 38 (down from 42), price to $600 (down from $1150), weight 4 (down from 4).

#### ScrN Zed Pack
- **Husk** cannot shoot while falling, dying, or evading other Husk's fireball (by [NikC-])
- **Siren** stops screaming immediately after dying (by [NikC-])
- **Crawler** cannot attack more than once per second. That fixes instant-kill issues where Crawlers were hitting
  again and again by jumping off each other's back.
- **HardPat** gets 33% damage resistance from Flare iDoT
- **HardPat** gets 25% damage resistance from melee body hits (no resistance to head hits)
- Fixed **FleshPound** dealing insane amount of damage when enraged while performing a hit (thanks [Joe])
- **TeslaHusk** now uses energy on repairing FP/FFP/TH head too. Previously, TH used energy to repair body health only,
  while the head was repaired for "free". On HoE, a fully charged TH can repair up to 3500hp, or 1750 body + 1750 head
  if the head is severely damaged. In previous versions, TH could repair 3500hp body + 3500hp head.
- **TeslaHusk** energy restore rate lowered by 25%. Previously, it took 10s to restore full energy up from 0. Now, it
  takes 12.5s.
- Fixed an issue where sometimes **TeslaHusk** could repair multiple targets in a raw, bypassing the cooldown timer.  


### v9.69.09 - FINAL

* **Version number of all ScrN packages bumped to v9.69.09** to be the same for the final release.
* Removed "50. Follow The Guardian" from the official game rotation (*KFMapVote.ini*). We recommend playing "51. Follow The Guardian: On The Clock" instead for better FTG experience.
* Updated `MapAliases` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*
* Fixed the warning "ShopVolume Accessed None MyTrader"
* If all players die on a test map, the game triggers `RestartPlayers` event, allowing the test map to respawn dead
  players. If the test map does not respawn players, the game is lost.
* Fixed an issue that prevented spawning more than 5 zeds at once on a test map.

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Lowered AK-12 headshot damage multiplier to x1.2 (down from x1.3)

#### Scrn Zed Pack

* Fixed an issue where **Tesla Husk** EMP explosion did too little or no damage to players

* Fixed a bug where an FTG game was considered won if players got killed by the boss.
* The game is considered LOST if all players die together with the boss (e.g., blew Pat on their own pipebombs)
* Doom mid-game boss name is hidden in the HL broadcast message to prevent early reveal (thanks [Duckbuster])
* Slightly adjusted per-game Hardcore Levels in *ScrnGames.ini*
  <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jd5S5XrgrVjq8V8NvHiTG1y6JgE83yzzBYKBeZjRHsg/edit?usp=sharing>

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Fixed an issue where HopMines were blocked by Blocking Volumes.

### v9.69.07

* Fixed a critical bug that prevented zed spawns in any door-related volumes (thanks [Joe])
  For instance, this bug completely blocked spawns on KF-TheGreatPyramid-Arena.
* Added map definitions for Clandestine and TheGreatPyramid-Arena.
* Hardcore Level in `HardcoreGames` now gets multiplied by per-difficulty `HLMult_X`.
  Previously, players could get "cheap" HL=6 by playing FTG on Normal.
* Replaced hardcored HL for Social Isolation with x1.5 multiplier.
  Now, enabling custom zeds in Social Isolation raises HL.
* `HLMult_Hard=0.60` (down from 0.75)
* `HLMult_Normal=0.40` (down from 0.75)
* Grittier Siren's HL lowered to 0.5 (down from 1.0)
* HL table: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jd5S5XrgrVjq8V8NvHiTG1y6JgE83yzzBYKBeZjRHsg/edit?usp=sharing>

#### ScrN SP

* Fixed "PlayInfo" warnings (thanks [nmmblez])

* Fixed an issue where locked perks could stay locked after map restart
* Restored default zed count in Doom3 Wave 10.

  (thanks [Duckbuster] and [Joe])

#### FTG

* Fixed a critical bug that caused team wipe on Patriarch kill
* Enhanced Stinky Clot's teleportation ability to get out of bad paths
* Fixed an issue where a player could be blamed multiple time for placing the base at a glitch spot
* **FTG On The Clock** v2.31 - fixed trader arrow in "trader path" waves

#### ScrN Zed Pack

* Players cannot interrupt HardPat's healing process by dealing damage on Suicidal/HoE

### v9.69.04

* Reduced Demolition's explosive resistance to 70% (down from 80%)
* Hardcore Mode: Reduced Demolition's explosive resistance to 35% (down from 50%)
* Increased Husk Gun ammo to 250/400 base/lv6 (up from 200/320)
* Fixed a bug where perk ammo bonus got applied twice on weapons that use the same ammo for both primary and secondary
  fire (Husk Gun, Boomstick). Thanks to [Lost_Champ]
* Fixed an issue where wave count displayed 0 in XCM DUEL (e.g., "Wave 3/0").
* "Sell Weapon" button in the Shop changes to "Donate to Charity" if the sell price is $0.
* Minor map improvements in *ScrnMapInfo.ini*

### v9.69.03

* Refactored *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* by commenting out the default values. That allows users to override a default value
  by uncommenting and changing the value. Keeping a value commented means "follow the default value" - if the default
  value changes in next version, it gets automatically applied on the user side without updating the config.
* Added `MaxPauseTime` and `MaxPauseTimePerWave` to *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*
* `bForceManualReload` deprecated
* `VoteSquad` / `MVOTE SPAWN` deprecated due to bugs and exploits
* **Short & Dramatic** game moved to GameLength=62 (from 82) to better indicate that it uses Social Isolation.
* **FTG On The Clock** v2.30 - replaced the introduction wave with modified version of XCM1.
* Fixed an issue where sometimes a healing cloud did not get replicated to other players.

### v9.69.02

* **XCM** v1.00 - final (more or less) release
* Winning a **Nightmare** game (GameLength=9) grants all four map achievements
* Added `HLMult` to *ScrnGames.ini*
* Fixed an issue where `MVOTE DIFF` before the game start didn't recalculate HL.
* Another attempt to fix "All Your Cookies Belong To Me" and "Eye for an Eye" achievements
* Fixed "Balls of Steel" achievement
* "KillWhore" achievement requires at least 50 kills.
* Zed aliases from *ScrnZeds.ini* can be used to blame monsters. For example:
  `MVOTE BLAME "SH" for teleporting behind me`

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Increased **RPG7** undetonated rocket damage to 500 (up from 400)
* Lowered **HRL** damage to 600 (down from 625)
* Changed HK417 achievement requirement to kill 7 Fleshpounds (thanks [Joe])

### v9.69.01

* Slightly lowered Zed count in Doom3 Wave 10
* When playing **Social Isolation** solo, the player always gets sick. Playing SocIso solo is not recommended.
* Reduced achievement player count requirement from 5-6 down to 3-4 where Zed health does not matter (thanks [Joe])
* "Unassisted" can be earned only on HoE (Kill 6p HoE FP)
* "Kenny" requires a game with at least 5 waves.
* Fixed an issue where Speedrun achievements could be earned in shorter games.
* Fixed "All Your Cookies Belong To Me" and "Eye for an Eye" achievements (thanks [Joe])
* `b10Stars` is taken into account when granting perk-color achievements (Gold, Green, Blue, etc.)
* Unlocking Blue perk achievement grants the Green one too. The same applies to Purple and Orange.
  That solves an issue where players may jump from Gold directly to Blue by winning a game with huge end-game bonuses.

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Lowered **HRL** arming distance to 8m (down from 10m) due to reduced explosion radius
* Fixed a bug in "AK Fanboy(-girl)" achievement

#### ScrN Zed Pack

* Fixed a bug that prevented **FP** raging from damage < 300 (behaved like FFP)
* Pat/HardPat's **Radial Attack**:
  * Removed ridiculous double damage to players with >50 armor
  * Made radial damage more consistent and scaled across difficulties.
    Originally, Pat did 54-108 damage to unarmored players, 108 - 216 to armored.
    Now, Pat does 52-87 damage on Hard, Suicidal: 63-105, Hoe: 73-122
  * Radial Attack can be performed only on Hard+ difficulty
  * Damage delivery matches the animation: first, Pat attacks players on the left, then on the right.
    Players straightly in front and at the back are attacked twice.
* Sui/HoE **HardPat**, when low on health, can perform Radial Attack against a single player (thanks [Vrana])
* Increased HardPat impale strike range from 0.9 to ~1.9m [[NikC-]]

### v9.68

* Introduced ScrN Shared Library - **ScrnShared.u** that is used by all mutators.
* All ScrN mutators have the same version numbering and extended from `ScrnShared.ScrnMutator`.
  No More HMG v5, HTec v4, ZedPack v2 - all are v9.68.xx from now on.
* Make sure to update ALL Scrn*.u packages!
* Added `ScrnAchMutator` - base class for achievement-tracking mutators.
* `MUTATE VERSION` displays all ScrN mutator versions, even inactive ones (e.g., achievement trackers)
* Make sure to add those new mutators to *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*:

```cpp
AutoLoadMutators=ScrnZedPack.ZedPackMut
AutoLoadMutators=ScrnHMG.HmgMut
```

* Added `LockTeamMinWaveTourney=1.0` in *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* to allow locking team earlier in Tourney Mode
  (e.g., prevent some random noobs from ruining your XCM run)
* Fixed an issue where `MVOTE LOCKPERK` did not display perk name
* Fixed zed precaching on client-side. Should remove stuttering on the first appearance of a custom zed or Doom monster.
* Perk and achievement progress is not saved on a test map. Players can still gain progress (for testing) but it is not
  saved to there perk database. Works like vanilla greylisted servers.
* Achievement earning restored on a test map (for testing) - but gained achievements are not saved.
* Added `bTest` to *ScrnGames.ini*. Forces `bTestMap=true` on any map for the given game mode.
* **XCM** v0.31
* Set `FtgSpawnDelayOnPickup=10` by default.
* Zeds nailed to a wall bleed out in ~20s. That prevents an issue on some custom maps where nailed zed could stuck
  outside the map.
* Added map definition for Suburbia.

#### ScrN Voting Handler

* Partial player name search in `MVOTE <cmd> <playername>`
* Fixed an issue where vote percent did not recalculate on player leaving

### v9.67.19

#### FTG

* Zed spawns made faster
* Added `FtgSpawnRateMod` and `FtgSpawnDelayOnPickup` config options to *ScrnGames.ini* for fine-tuning.
* FTG-OTC v2.20: adjusted spawn rates and added more zeds to "Kill Remaining" waves to give more
  time for Stinky Clot to get to the trader.

#### TSC

* Deprecated `LateJoinerCashBonus` - replaced by `StartingCashBonus` and `bStartingCashRelative` in *ScrnGames.ini*
* Deprecated `OvertimeTeamMoneyPenalty` - harder waves are used in overtime instead of cutting dosh.
* Added `TSCOT` and `TSCSD` waves in *ScrnWaves.ini* for Overtime and Sudden Death respectively.
* Lowered Overtime wave count to 1 by default (down from 2). Now there are 7 normal waves + 1 OT + 1 SD.

#### ScrnGames/Waves.ini

* Added `Doom3DisableSuperMonstersFromWave` to disable Doom3 mid-game bosses on last waves before the boss.
* Doom3 mid-game boss disabled on Doom3 Wave 10 because the final wave wave is generally harder when boss is not spawned
* `MaxZombiesOnce` can be used to control end-game boss waves. If not set, the default value for RULE_KillBoss is 16.

### v9.67.18

* Fixed an issue when players started a game as dead if joined from spectators
* Added `PlayerInfoOffset` config variable to `ScrnHUD` (*ScrnUser.ini*) allowing to tweak vertical offset of player
  health bars. For example, bars can be lowered down to the ground to prevent obscuring vision.
  The config variable can be controlled via ScrN Features GUI or `BarOffset` console command.
* Fixed multiple issues in Hardcore Level calculation
* Raised XCM HL to 30 if played on HoE + Hardcore Mode
* Fixed an issue where TSC displayed "GET BACK TO THE BASE OR DIE!" even when the base loss did not result in a wipe.
* FTG displays a regular "GET BACK TO THE BASE!" message at the beginning, then switches to
  "GET BACK TO THE BASE OR DIE!" for the last 12s before the wipe. Message is displayed every 4 seconds, allowing
  players to predict the remaining time to get back to the base:
  * regular message: time left > 15s;
  * 3 die messages at 12, 8, and 4s left respectively;
  * team wipe in 4s after the 3rd die message.

### v9.67.17

* Removed HoE difficulty requirement for HoE map achievements. It still requires HL15+, therefore, players need
  add more custom zeds on Suicidal to boost HL.
* Suicidal map achievements can be earned on any custom game, included user-defined (GameLength=60+)
* Tweaked HL increase for Doom3 monsters to ensure HL15+ on HoE even if no mid-game bosses spawned.
* Enabled Tesla Husks and Shivers in FTG by default to give a HoE map achievement for winning a Suicidal game.
* Disabled Hard+ map achievements in TSC

##### Map Achievement Summary

* Normal ach is granted for winning any game (including TSC)
* Hard ach requires HL5+ and at least one custom/super/doom zed (excluding Boss)
* Suicidal ach requires HL10+ and one of the following:
  * Turbo Floor
  * Nightmare game (GameLength=9)
  * Social Isolation
  * Any custom game with GameLength >= 60
* HoE ach requires HL15+ and one of the following:
  * FTG
  * Doom3 demons
  * XCM (GameLength=7)

### v9.67.16

* Fixed a bug that preventing earning map achievements and end game bonuses
* HoE map achievement requires HoE difficulty (cannot get it on FTG/Doom3 Suicidal)
* Winning XCM grants HoE map achievement

### v9.67.15

* **XCM** moved into beta phase (v0.30)

* Random map voting allows also game and difficult selection. For example:
  `MVOTE MAP RANDOM DooM3 HoE`
* Added `RandomMapStatBonus` to *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* - allows boosting `EndGameStatBonus` when voted for a random map.
  Should encourage playing on different maps instead of BioticsLab 24/7.
* Added alias `*` for `RANDOM`. `MVM *` is the shortest way to vote for a random map.
* Typing `^` at the end of the map name selects the first match even if multiple matches detected. For example,
  `MVOTE MAP LONDON^` votes for KF-WestLondon even if KF-WestLondonNight and KF-WestLondonWinter exist on the server.
* Fixed a bug where single pistols headshot kills did not give Sharpshooter XP progress

#### ScrnMapInfo.ini

Added map definitions for the following maps:

* AbusementPark
* Aperture
* Biohazard
* HospitalHorrors (fix)
* Wyre

#### Code Changes

* Moved `BarStyleItems` and `HudStyleItems` from `ScrnTab_UserSettings` to `ScrnHUD` and renamed to `BarStyles` and
  `HudStyles` respectively. That allows custom HUD to be selected by the player via GIU with zero changes to GUI and
  without forcing selection to the custom HUD.
* `PlayerInfoVersion` command deprecated. Use `ToggleBarStyle` instead.
* `bCoolHud` and `bCoolHudLeftAlign` are not configurable anymore. Replaced with `HudStyle`.

### v9.67.14

* `MVM` - console command as a shortcut for `MVOTE MAP`
* Fixed missing smiley tags in ServerPerks
* Fixed multiple issues in  **XCM DUEL**
* Adjusted zed spawns in **FTG**
* Adjusted zed spawn rate in **FTG-OTC**.
* ScrnWaves.ini: Fixed an issue where waves with `bRandomSquads=false` doubled zed spawn rate
* Adjusted **XCM** waves to compensate the above bug fix

### v9.67.11

* New game mode: **XCM DUEL** - two players in TSC-like game try to survive as long as possible in XCM waves.
  The one who dies first, loses.
* `MVOTE DIFFICULTY` does not require map restart the match has not begun yet.
* Mid-game difficulty changes are allowed on a test map.
* TSC: During Overtime or Sudden Wave, if one team gets wiped, then other wins immediately. No need to survive until
  the end of the wave anymore. XCM DUEL has only Sudden Death waves.

### v9.67.10

* Entering the full map name in `MVOTE MAP` have selection priority over a partial match.
  For example, previously it was impossible to vote for KF-Foundry, if you the server also had KF-FoundryLightsOut
  because it selected two maps. Now, `MVOTE MAP KF-FOUNDRY` selects KF-Foundry.
* Code execution optimization. Replaced `ReplaceText()` calls with `Repl()` since the former is an UnrealScript
  function (slow) while the latter is a native one. I have no idea why Tripwire wrote `ReplaceText()` in
  UnrealScript instead of C++.

### v9.67.09

* Added `bTestMap` and `GuardianLight` to *ScrnMapInfo.ini*
* TSC/FTG: lowered default brightness of Base Guardian (but can be altered in *ScrnMapInfo.ini*)
* Achievement progress disabled on test maps, but perk changes are always allowed.
* Fixed a bug in `MVOTE ZED FP SPAWN`

#### ScrN Zed Pack

* Added *ScrnZedPack.ini* to change headshot detection on dedicated servers.
* `bHeadshotSrvAnim=false` fixes headshot detection. Set it to false for vanilla behavior (where you cannot decapitate
  a Bloat while your noobie teammates is body-spamming him)
* Reduced **Siren** Vortex Pull strength on Hard and below.
* Made **Crawlers** lighter. Now it is easier to push them. You can even stomp Crawlers to kill them.

### v9.67.08

#### ScrnMapInfo.ini

* Completely reworked the *ScrnMapInfo.ini*. Now it has per-map objects (somewhat similar to Games/Waves/Zeds).
* Zed spawning can be fine-tuned for each map via multiple config options.
* Added `DebugZedSpawn` console command which draws zombie volumes where zed spawned. Works only in Solo/Listen mode.
* Allows altering Stinky Clot paths in FTG individually for each map.
* Check the default *ScrnMapInfo.ini* for details.
* ScrnMapInfo.ini is far from complete, and have only few map definitions. Please contribute!

#### ScrnGames.ini

* Added `bAllowZedEvents` and `bDebug`
* Zed squad logging obeys `LogZedSpawnLevel` under `[ScrnBalanceSrv.ScrnGameType]` in *KillingFloor.ini*

### ScrnBalanceSrv.ini

* Added `OriginalMap` under `MapAlias` to specify the map object in *ScrnMapInfo.ini* (if it differs from `AchName`)
* `bForceEvent=True` by default but now it obeys `bAllowZedEvents` value in *ScrnGames.ini*

#### FTG

* wrote yet another workaround for Stinky Clot when he gets stuck.
* fixed an issue when Stinky Clot could get a 300uu/s speed boost while not seen by the players.
* Added `bDebugStinkyPath` config option under `[ScrnBalanceSrv.FtgGame]` in *KillingFloor.ini* to log Stinky paths

#### Bugfixes and QoL improvements

* **XCM v0.21**
* Speed up **M32** drrum close animation during reload interruption. Now it is less annoying while still realistic
  (unlike vanilla)
* ScrN Features: added a checkbox to show left pistol ammo separately (while dual-wielding)
* Fixed multiple log warnings

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Lowered **HK-417** weight to 7 (down from 8)
* Fixed warnings

#### ScrN Zed Pack

* Fixed multiple log warnings

### v9.67.07

#### Balance

* Commando now has 60% damage bonus @ Lv6 like all other perks (up from 50%)
* Commando received +50% bigger magazines for perked weapons (up from +25%)
* Removed Bullpup bullet penetration due to increased stats
* M4 magazine size restored to 30 (down from 32).
* M4 damage increased to 41 to match M4-203 primary damage.
* Regular M4 headshot multiplier lowered to x1.2 (down from x1.3)
* M4-203 price increased to $1750 (up from $1600)
* Gunslinger has lower recoil with laser pistols while laser sights are active
* Removed armor requirement for Cowboy Mode. Now Gunslinger can wear armor like all other perks.
* Lowered Demolitions discount on pipebombs. Now Demo receives -60% discount @ Lv6 like on all other weapons.
* Support Specialist carry weight lowered to 24 (down from 25). I have no idea why Support received weight buff before.
* Removed M99, CrossBuzzSaw, HRL, and RPG from Tourney Mode (unless TOURNEY_ALL_WEAPONS flag is set)

#### QoL improvements and bug fixes

* `MVOTE MAP RESTART` - restarts the current map
* `MVOTE MAP RANDOM` - votes for random map
* `MVOTE MAP WESTLONDON` - votes for specific map
* `MVOTE MAP LONDON` - short names are allowed too
* `MVOTE MAP LONDON XCM HOE` - Votes for map/game/difficulty
* `MVOTE MAP HELP` - returns available maps and game modes
* `MVOTE MAP LIST` - returns available maps
* `MVOTE MAP LIST OBJ` - returns available maps for the specified game mode. In this case, `OBJ` is an acronym for
  Objective Mode
* Added `LeftGunAmmo 1|0` console command to display left gun ammo separately in case of dual pistols.
  By default, classic mode is used - combined ammo counter.
* Restored `MVOTE BORING` for legacy games (`KFGameType`).
* Fixed an issue where `MVOTE BORING` could cause zeds to spawn further from players due to overused close volumes.
* Optimized zed spawn mechanics, achieving at least 30x better CPU usage (removing lag spikes),
  especially on map with many ZombieVolumes, like FrightYard.
* On a test map, `MUTATE ZED FP SPAWN` can be used without admin privileges
* Shotgun pellets can damage the same targets no more than twise (head + body). It fixes insane shotgun damage
  on servers with high TickRate, where shotgun pellets do damage per every tick.
* Reduced network replication of game speed during zed time exit. This should reduce lags at zed time end,
  especially on servers with high TickRate.
* Fixed warning: "PlayAnim: Sequence 'HitF_Dual9mmm' not found for mesh"
* Fixed a bug where a player did not receive burning damage after killing the Husk who set player on fire.

#### KillingFloor.ini

* Added `VotingHandlerOverride=KFMapVoteV2.KFVotingHandler` to `ScrnGameType` and `ScrnStoryGameInfo` to override map
  voting handlerr to KFMapVoteV2 by default. New players do not have to edit KillingFloor.ini to install the bundle.
* Added `LogZedSpawnLevel=2` to ScrnGameType config (KillingFloor.ini). Set it to 7 to debug zed spawns.

#### XCM v0.20

* Reworked early wave spawns
* Fixed a bug that halved zed spawn rate
* Fixed another bug that slowered bug zed squad spawns
* Lowered usage of Sucicide Timer beeps (except the last minute remaining)

* Fixed an issue where Stinky Clot could spawn too close to the players
* Log more telemetry data if Stinky Clot gets stuck

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Restored normal HS multiplier for *VAL* (x1.1, was x1.0)
* *HK-417* magazine size raised to 20 and price to $3500

* HardPat does not become invulnerable anymore. Now, when clocked and escaping, he has 80% damage resistance,
  but can attack players who block him.
* Male and Female FP do not attack or push each other anymore
* Players can push Crawlers away - the latter are too small to block players
* Fixed warning about missing jump animation for crawler

### v9.67.05

* Fixed Suicide Timer being out of sync between the server and clients.
* `SUICIDE` console command triggers the suicide bomb if such exists. That can be used as a last resort to kill the
  remaining zeds via sacrificing.

### v9.67.04

* Fixed an issue when last spawned zeds can be immediately killed by the game
* XCM: Rebalanced Wave 10 and added the boss wave. Patriarch has +50% hp in XCM.
* XCM: lowered suicide timer. Solo player has 2:30 per wave; +30s per player.
* Added `GameVersion` to both ScrnGames.ini and ScrnWaves.ini for version tracking and sync validation.

### v9.67.03

* Added last two missing waves in XCM (w8 and 9)
* Balanced XCM spawns (no more BL + HU spawns)
* Fixed a bug where players spawned with achievement-related "candies" in TSC or/and Tourney

### v9.67.01

* Reduced shotgun penetration after hitting medium/big zeds.
* Fixed a bug where surviving a game with no boss lead to a loss.
* Fixed an issue where `bRandomSquads` and `bRandomSpecialSquads` were messed up with each other.
* Added `SuicideTimePerPlayerMult` in both ScrnGames.ini and ScrnWaves.ini
* Added `bMoreAmmoBoxes` to ScrnWaves.ini. Now ammo boost can be set for any wave, not only `RULE_GrabAmmo`.
* Fixed an issue where a suicide bomb counted as a regular pipebomb and could be triggered at wave start due to limit
* Added XCM Wave7 (W8 and W9 are not ready yet)

### v9.67

**WARNING! ScrnWaves.ini got split on ScrnGames.ini, ScrnZeds.ini and ScrnWaves.ini**

#### ScrnGames.ini

* TSC `NWaves`, `OTWaves`, and `SDWaves` moved from KFMapVote.ini.
* Added `MinDifficulty` and `MaxDifficulty` to limit difficulty range for the given game. For example, setting
  MinDifficulty=7 and MaxDifficulty=7 forces difficulty to HoE regardless of KFMapVote.ini or `MVOTE DIFF`
* Added `bForceTourney` and `TourneyFlags` to override Tourney Mode
* Passing `?Difficulty=` and `?Tourney=` in server cmd line or KFMapVote.ini is **unreliable and should NOT be used**.
  The game caches command line arguments and passes them from game to game even if those are not set in KFMapVote.ini.
* `bRandomTrader` - allows disabling trader randomization (does not work in TSC)
* `SuicideTime`, `SuicideTimePerWave` - attaches a pipebomb to every player that triggers in the given time.
  Forces players to finish the game/wave within the specified timelimit. This can be fine-tuned via game's

#### ScrnWaves.ini

* if `bStartAtTrader=true` but `bOpenTrader=false` players spawn at random trader. Can be used on wave 1 to spawn
  players in different places.
* `SuicideTime`, `bSuicideTimeReset` - allows fine-tuning the game's suicide timer for each wave.
* Putting `^` (keep with above) at the beginning of squad definition makes the squad always spawn after the previous
  one event if `bRandomSquads=true`. Multiple squads can be chained together. The next example always spawns Bloat,
  then two Siren after FP, and two Husks after SC. However, the game randomly picks either FP or SC to spawn first.

```cpp
Squads=FP
Squads=^ BL
Squads=^ 2*SI
Squads=SC
Squads=^ 2*HU  
```

#### ScrN Brutal KF Bundle

* Excluded Workshop packages in NetReduce.ini. This should fix Xmas ammo boxes on ESL and Ice Cave.

#### FTG

* Made Stinky Clot fatter while invulnerable (green) to prevent him from falling into narrow holes

#### Social Isolation

* Disabled penalty for coughing in shop (due to multiple reports of being too annoying)

* Infected by other players have more severe symptoms than the initially infected.

#### Balance

* Gunslinger deals 50% more pistol damage to *Bloats*, allowing popping their heads as efficient as Sharpie.
* Killing a *Bloat*  with a pistol headshot gives +3 Gunslinger XP progress
* Killing a *Scrake* with a pistol headshot gives +7 Gunslinger XP progress

#### eXpert Challenge Mode (XCM)

A new game mode designed to push pro players to the limit both in individual skills and team coordination.
Work in progress. More info here:
<https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ScrNBalance/discussions/9/4580716151550023598/>

#### Hardcore Mode

* Removed `bHardcore` from ScrnBalance.ini. Hardcore Mode can be enabled via game difficulty (6 or 8).
* Non-hardcore perks are automatically disabled in Hardcore Mode
* Fixed Difficulty=6 (Siu+Hardcore) and Difficulty=8 (HoE+Hardcore) in KFMapVote.ini  (thanks to [nmmblez])
* Config option `HLMult_Hardcore` (default 15%) - extra Hardcore Level multiplier in Hardcore Mode
* Field and Combat Medics receive 50% more damage from Siren Scream (and any damage that bypasses armor)
* Support Spec. has 20% slower fire rate and receives 50% more damage from Gorefasts
* Sharpshooter deals half damage to bodies and has no reload speed bonus (except LAR).
  Receives 50% more damage from Scrakes/Jasons.
* Commando has no extra ammo bonus and receives quad damage from Stalkers
* Berserker has no damage resistance against fire (except Doom3) and moves extremely slow while holding Syringe.
* Firebug has only 50% fire damage resistance (but still immune to self fire). Receives quad damage from Clots.
* Demolitions Expert receives one extra pipebomb per two levels (max 5 pipes on lv6) and 50% explosive resistance.
  Receives 50% more damage from Fleshpounds.
* Grenades, rockets, and HuskGun projectiles do not fly through teammates in Hardcore Mode.
* Gunslinger has reduced reload speed bonus and receives double damage from Crawlers

#### ScrnUser.ini

* Moved ScrN user settings (ScrnPlayerController, ScrnHUD) from User.ini to ScrnUser.ini.
* (ScrnHUD) `PerkStarsMax` (default=30) - limits the number of perk level starts drawn on HUD
* (ScrnHUD) `bShowDamages` replaced with `ShowDamages` which has three options:
  * 0 - hides damage numbers (same as old `bShowDamages=false`)
  * 1 - combines multiple damages of the same type (e.g., shotgun pellets) and displays the total amount
  * 2 - shows all damage numbers (same as old `bShowDamages=true`)

#### Other changes

* Introduced perk short names (`ScrnVeterancyTypes.ShortName`). Type `MVOTE LOCKPERK` without arguments to display perk
  list.  You can use either perk number, short or long name to identify voted perk(-s).
* Locking/unlocking multiple perks at once. For example: `MVOTE LOCKPERK FB DEMO BER`
* Inverse perk selector by using `!`. The following command locks all perks but Sharpshooter, Commando and Gunslinger:
  `MVOTE LOCKPERK ! SHA CMD GS`
* Typing `MVOTE LOCKPERK` without arguments displays perk lists with numbers and short names.
  You can use either perk number, short or long name to identify voted perk(-s)
* Fixed glitch in MK23 and HC tactical reload animations in solo and listen server modes
* Added left pistol ammo counter to Classic HUD
* Added secondary ammo (e.g., M203) counter to Cool HUD

#### Code Changes

* `ScrnPlayerController.ClientPlayerDamaged()` made protected to prevent access from elsewhere.
  Call `DamageMade()` instead.
* Set `bHardcoreReady=true` in custom perks to make them available in Hardcore Mode

### v9.66

* Fixed a bug that could cause too high recoil during the Zed Time
* 3rd person view disabled in TSC and Tourney Mode. In addition, a new config option `bAllowBehindView`
  added to *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*.
* Reduced M99 penetration damage reduction to 5% (down from 20%)
* Increased Combat Shotgun reload rate to 0.6s per shell (from 0.75s)
* Removed Combat Shotgun spread penalty for not aiming down the sights - it has laser sights after all.

#### ScrnZedPack v2

* Added and reworked all vanilla zeds to ScrnZedPack
* Renamed most zed classes inside ScrnZedPack (check *ScrnWaves.ini*)
* Enhanced head detection
* Fixed projection of laser sights on big zed heads

###### Bloat

* Doubled head health (25 -> 50 base)
* Head health increases by 20% per extra player. 6p HoE Bloat now has 175hp
  Not too much, but cannot be decapitated with just two off-perk 9mm shots
* Bloat cannot puke while decapitated
* Decapitating a Bloat immediately stops him from vomiting

###### Siren

* Removed the scream canceling exploit
* Siren cannot scream when decapitated
* Decapitating Siren during screaming eliminates any further damage.
* Fixed vortex pull effect (it has been bugged in vanilla since the very beginning didn't work in the most cases).
* Reduced scream damage by 25% to compensate for fixed vortex pull.
* Siren scream shatters frozen zeds nearby, turning their bodies into deadly ice shards

###### Scrake

* Saw loop damage now scales per difficulty. In vanilla it did not change, that why SC did so little damage on HoE.
* Base saw loop damage reduced by 20% to compensate fixed difficulty scaling. HoE saw damage is higher by ~40% now.

#### Horzine Technician v5

* Removed Cryo Sirens because regular Sirens from ScrnZedPack can shatter frozen zeds now
* Sirens can scream just to shatter zeds in front, even when not seeing players (e.g., standing around a corner next to
  frozen zeds)
* Optimized performance of Freeze Mechanics
* Increased mag capacity bonus for ZED Guns and Cryo Thrower to 50% at level 6 (up from 35%)
* Increased Cryo Thrower total ammo to 960 (up from 840)
* Reduced ZED Gun MKII weight to 5 (down from 6), so it can be carried along with Cryo Mass Driver and Horzine Armor
* Fixed point-blank headshot detection for ice darts (the same bug as for shotguns)

### v9.65

* Perk progress calculation now takes into account possible 32-bit integer overflow. A signed 32-bit integer may store
  numbers up to ~2147M. Some players have reached such an insane XP level, which caused perk progress to appear negative
  due to overflow. Now this case is properly handled, and perk progress is capped at ~2147M. However, reaching
  ~4294M will cause the unsigned int32 overflow, and the perk level gets reset back to 0.
  [nmmblez], time to think about lowering XP bonus levels ;)
* Added a hardcoded limitation for MaxPerksLevel <= 70. Higher levels could raise requirements beyond int32 capacity.
* Adjusted level requirement numbers for all perks. Previously, getting from Lv4 to Lv6 was much harder than from Lv6
  to Lv10. It does not make sense since perk level rebalance in v9.50, when Lv5 and Lv6 stopped getting way higher
  bonuses comparing to lower levels. Now, getting the next level is always harder than the previous one; Lv6 is easier
  to reach, but lv7-11 - harder. Lv12-30 have more or less the same requirements as before; lv31+ are harder to gain.
  Lv70 has 2140M damage requirement; it is the absolute maximum to achieve, which still fits into int32.
* Perks that require lower thresholds (such as Sharpshooter or Gunslinger) are capped at Lv70 too, for consistency
  with other perks.
* Removed Stalker kill requirement for Commando. Now, all ScrN perks have one requirement.
* Stalker/Shiver kills give bonus XP to Commando: one Stalker kill = 1K damage bonus.
* Welding gives bonus XP to Support Spec.: 100 welding points = 1K damage bonus.
* Sniper damage that is high enough to stun a Scrake (>=667) gives bonus XP to Sharphooter.
  Previously, such as option could be enabled via `SharpProgMinDmg` config value. Now it is hardcoded to 667.
* Deprecated config options: `Post6RequirementScaling`, `WeldingRequirementScaling`, `StalkerRequirementScaling`,
  `SharpProgMinDmg` (*ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*)
* Purged all deprecated variable declarations from ScrnBalance.
* FTG: fixed an issue where Stinky Clot could continuously blame a player if getting stuck.
* FTG: added a workaround to get Stinky Clot out of a 3-waypoint loop path (infinitely going A=>B=>C=>A)

### v9.64.09

* FTG: Fixed an issue where a wrong player got blamed for putting the base in a glitch spot (thanks [Joe])
* If the team is locked (`MVOTE LOCKTEAM`), newcomers are put into spectators rather than appearing as dead teammates.
* Fixed an issue where Tourney Mode stayed active after loading a game config without the `?Tourney` option.
* Game config's `?Difficulty` option has higher precedence than `MVOTE DIFF`. In other words, players cannot change
  difficulty for game configs that have hardcoded difficulty option in *KFMapVote.ini*
* Fixed ScrN game hints (thanks [P-Jay]).
* By the looks of it, any config (.ini) or localization (.int) line cannot exceed 4096 characters.
* 4k limitation also applies on `GameConfig` lines in *KFMapVote.ini*. All GameConfig lines *together*
  cannot exceed 4k characters.
* Game modes "52. FTG: Fight The Patriarchs" and "83. On The Clock" removed from the standard rotation to reduce
  GameConfig size and meet the 4k limitation.

### v9.64.07

* Zeds can fight each other again (was broken since v6)
* `bTraderSpeedBoost` disabled in Story Mode
* Machete-sprinting disabled in Tourney Mode, TSC, or Story Mode.
* Max Machete-boost capped at 120 (down from 150). Now, Machete-sprinting follows 20+20+20 principle: first 20 steps
  with high boost (+3), then 20 average (+2), and small boost at the end (+1).
* Machete damage boost is applied only on the first hit after the pickup or a kill.
* Added `?Tourney=0` options to all non-tourney games modes in *KFMapVote.ini*
  It seems that unspecified options carried values from the previous maps.

### v9.64.06

* Enabled **Tactical Reload** with full mag but initially empty chamber for all closed-bolt weapons, including
  **ScrN Weapon Pack** (by [Duckbuster])
* Fixed player scream for medic on low health (it was in the vanilla code but never worked due to bugs)
* Code optimization

### v9.64.05

* Reworked zed spawn rate calculation by throwing out all the Tripwire's code into a trashcan.
  Now, the zed spawn rate increases consistently by the *alive* player count.
* Deprecated config options: `Post6ZedSpawnInc`, `Post6AmmoSpawnInc`, `Post6ZedsPerPlayer`, `bAlterWaveSize`,
  `bSpawnRateFix` (*ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*)
* `MVOTE BORING` made consistent across maps. Previously, the boring vote was scaled by the map-specific
  `WaveSpawnPeriod` value. Now, boring vote has 3 stages no matter of the map:  DOUBLE/QUAD/INSANE spawns.
* Boring vote raises the *Hardcore Level*. HL increase value depends of the game's HL and remaining zed count.
  There must be at least 100 zeds left in the wave for the boring vote to increase HL.
  HL bonus is granted at the end of the wave. A player death resets the boring value and HL bonus.
* Yet another attempt to fix the negative team dosh bug
* Made sure that a player with 100hp and 25 armor always survives one FP rage hit.
  Previously, it was RNG because FP dealt 114..128 damage on HoE. Now, FP deals 114..124 damage.
* Last survivor's self-healing gives +50hp (same as in the Solo mode)
* Modified spawn inventory (make sure to update *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*)
* Removed "Boomstick before AA12" checkbox from ScrN Features. Use gun slots instead.
* Added "No Weapon Autoswitch" checkbox to ScrN Features

#### TSC

* Fixed uneven teams balance health bonus (previously, it gave extra +100hp to the smaller team)
* Zed Squad definition in *ScrnWaves.ini* now uses the biggest team size for min/max player restriction
  instead of total player count in the game. Previously, `SpecialSquads=8: 4*FP` could spawn quad FP in 4v4 TSC game.
* Fixed an issue where Commando spawned without weapons
* Fixed inconsistent PvP damage scale. Now PvP damage always deals 10% of the damage, including damage bonuses.
  Headshot multiplier for all weapons is x2, except shotguns (x1) and sniper rifles (original, x2 at least)
* Fixed an exploit where a dead player could free roam after reconnect
* Player death charges the team for constant $100 instead of random nonsense.
* Killing a teammate transfers up to $200 from the killer to the victim
* Introduced **Tourney Mode** flags (see the default *KFMapVote.ini* for details)
* Known Issue: Damaging a Field Medic displays full damage because armor absorption takes place later in the code
* Known Issue: Flares do not damage other players

#### ScrN Waves

* Added new settings: `LaterWavePct`, `LaterWaveSpawnCooldown`, `SpecialSquadCooldown`.
  Check the default *ScrnWaves.ini* for details.
* Added a special squad "Jasons+Scrakes+Huks" for Wave 9 and 10

### v9.64.03

* Player can **interrupt reloading by throwing the weapon on the ground**
* if `bPrioritizePerkedWeapons=true` in *User.ini*, perked weapons receive a higher rating when making a decision to
  auto-switch to the newly obtained weapon or not.
* Player may set `bNeverSwitchOnPickup=true` in *User.ini* to completely prevent weapon auto-switching.
* `bNeverSwitchOnPickup=true` breaks machete-sprinting with the default drop weapon key. However, there is a workaround:
  `set input SPACE GetWeapon ScrnMachete | OnRelease ThrowWeapon`
* Slightly increased the movement speed of **Stinky Clot**. Moreover, speed now scales by the game difficulty.
* Fixed Stinky Clot's head hitbox.
* Fixed yet another navigation bug that could cause Stinky Clot to get stuck.
* Stinky Clot does not move to the trader during the boss wave or if the trader will be closed for the next wave.

### v9.64.01

* Ready and View Map buttons switch places so the ready button is at the same position as in the vanilla game.
* Fixed a bug that could prevent ammo boxes from respawning
* Changed how Medic's "better" armor behaves. Previously, medic armor blindly reduced all incoming damage by 60%
  (vanilla - by 75%).
  For instance, HoE FP may deal 120 damage. Medic with just 1% armor reduced the incoming damage to 120 - 60% = 48.
  **Now, medic armor reduces damage by up to double amount of its armor points**.
  So having 1% armor removes only 2hp damage; 10% - up to 20hp;
  to fully reduce FP 120hp attack by 60% (72hp), medic needs at least 36AP.
* `KFVeterancyTypes.GetBodyArmorDamageModifier()` deprecated.
  `ScrnVeterancyTypes.ShieldReduceDamage()` used instead.

#### TSC

* The default key for the base setup moved from AltFire to `Duck` / `Crouch`. Players still can set the dedicated
  key for base setup, e.g.: `set input B SetupBase`, `set input X DropFlag`
* Fixed an issue when switching from TSC to FTG kept the `NWaves` option (wave count) from the previous game
* Disabled free roam camera for dead players
* Stunned Base Guardians wake up on a wave start.
* Stun time: 30s, wakeup duration: 10s.
* The Base Guardian cannot be damaged/stunned while waking up or during the first 10s of a wave.
* Increased the light radius of Base Guardians to cover almost the entire base while guarding.
* Combat Medic does not get armor protection bonus from human damage.
* Lowered Field Medic armor protection bonus from human damage to 30% (down from 40%).
* Combat Medic cannot see enemy health bars. Only Field Medic can see those.
* Fixed health balance of uneven teams. Both teams should have the same total amount of health points.
  For instance, When playing 4v5, members of the 4p team will have 125hp (4x125 = 5x100)

#### ScrN Waves

* New game mode: **42. TSC Tourney**
* Game mode **51. FTG: On The Clock** replaced with the new version (by [nmmblez])
* Added `TraderSpeedBoost` to `ScrnGameLength` config (*ScrnWaves.ini*) to allow per-game trader speed boost control.
* Fixed an issue when sometimes dead players might respawn despite `bRespawnDeadPlayers=false` for the current wave.
* Fixed an issue where `RULE_GrabAmmo` did not spawn enough ammo boxes on the map with a low ammo box count.

### v9.64

#### Gunslinger

* Dual HC, .44, and MK23: Alt fire switches between single and dual pistols
* Cool HUD displays ammo counters separately for left and right guns.
* Dual HC, .44, and MK23 moved to slot 3 by default (previously, only GS had it in slot 3)
* Removed extra reload speed bonus for Cowboy Mode due to tactical reloads.
* The Standard reload speed bonus for revolvers increased to 100% (up from 60%) to compensate for the lack of tactical reload.
* Added 60% fire rate bonus for Colt Python (ScrN Weapon Pack)
* Dual-9mm: fixed recoil
* Dual-MK23: Fixed a bug that gave +2 ammo for
* Dual-44: if one of the revolvers is full, then reload only the other one
* Fixed bug in toggling Cowboy Mode on picking up or losing armor.
* Buying a second pistol adds initial ammo too
* Lowered initial ammo for pistols to 5 magazines
* Gunslinger ammo bonus is now an extra magazine (1/12 or ~8.33%) per level (down from 10%).
* Fixed a bug when Dual Laser Pistols prevented picking up a first aid kit

#### Money Balance

* Weapon prices are rounded up after applying the perk discount. It turns fancy prices, such as $299, into more straightforward $300
* Lowered .44 ammo price to $10 (down from $11).
* Downgrading armor is for free if the player's current armor >= max armor of the downgraded class.
  For example, you can downgrade Combat Armor to Jacket armor for free if your current armor >= 25.
  If armor < 25, then a full purchase ($100) must be made.

#### Shop

* Trying to sell the armor actually causes buying an Armored Jacket (25 armor). Now you can easily downgrade to or
  buy an Armored Jacket buy "selling" armor - double click or press BACKSPACE on the selected armor in your inventory.
* Pressing ENTER key on a player inventory item fills full ammo (for a weapon) or repairs the armor.
* Pressing F7 fills armor.
* Fixed a bug when selling weapons with BACKSPACE did not work if the mouse cursor was outside of the inventory list

### v9.63.21

* Shop: Selecting the armor item on the left side automatically opens the armor category on the right side.
  That allows easy upgrading/downgrading the armor type (Jacket/Combar/Horzine).
  Armor category is a weapon category that contains at least two armor items.
  See `WeaponCategories` in *ServerPerks.ini*
* Shop: Fixed a minor issue where damage type and headshot checkboxes were displayed for armor items.
* Lobby: the Disconnect button moved to the left side of the screen.

### v9.63.20

#### Weapon Balance

* Fixed **Point-Blank Headshot Detection** bug for all grenades, rockets, flares, Husk Gun and Trenchgun
* Fixed aiming of Husk Gun and Flare Revolver. Now the projectiles should fly where the iron sights point at
* **Trenchgun** weight lowered to 6 (down from 8)
* Lowered **MAC10** recoil
* `SkippedTradeTimeMult` default value lowered down to 0.75 (down from 1.00)
  meaning that only 75% of the skipped trader time gets transferred to the next wave
* `bDoubleDoT` deprecated because it was causing unnecessary flinching and messed up hitboxes even more than usual.
  **Smart DoT** is introduced instead. Under normal conditions, Smart DoT deals burn damage once per second.
  However, if the burn victim is about to die, Smart DoT kills it ASAP instead of waiting for the next second.
  For example, a Crawler with 60hp left is set on fire, burn DPS = 50. Standard DoT mechanics would kill the Crawler
  in two seconds: leaving it with 10hp in the first second, then overkilling it in the second.
  The Deprecated Double DoT would kill the Crawler in 1.5s.
  Smart DoT kills it in 1.2s: 60hp / 50hp/s = 1.2s.
* Continuous hits with incendiary bullets crispify zeds faster
* It is harder to re-crispify zed (apply panic to already crispy zed)
* Continuous hits with low-damage fire weapons can keep the high-damage DoT.

#### Social Isolation

* Removed restriction for infected persons to share dosh. Infected weapons still cannot be picked up by others.
* The penalty for coughing inside a shop gets charged only if there are other players in the shop that are potentially
  healthy (have no visual symptoms). That should motivate the infected players to do shopping separately from the
  healthy ones.
* Coughing penalty reduced down to $50. In addition, the coughing player gets thrown out of the shop.

### v9.63.16

#### Weapon Balance

##### FN FAL

* Restored vanilla fire rate, spread and recoil
* Reduced base damage to 55 (down from 65)
* Raised headshot multiplier to x1.75 (up from x1.30)
* Loaded with armor-piercing rounds (7.62x51mm NATO AP).
* Fleshpounds have lower damage resistance: 25% instead of standard 50%.
* Increased ammo price: $18 -> $25 per magazine.
* Removed single fire mode. Now there are two modes left: full auto and 2-bullet fixed-burst mode.
* "Brutally SCAR'd" achievement can be unlocked with FN FAL too.

##### Gunslinger

* **Magnum .44** headshot multiplier raised to x1.30 (up from x1.20)
* Shooting with 9mm pistol(-s) does not affect movement anymore

#### Spawn Balance

* Adjusted spawn inventory. Make sure to update *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini*.

#### ScrN Waves

* Fixed missing Ghosts in game "83. On The Clock". Make sure to update *ScrnWaves.ini*.

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Nerfed **AK12** reload speed from 3.0/2.0s to 3.6/2.5s (full/tactical)
* **HK417** loaded with armor-piercing rounds (7.62x51mm NATO AP):
  * Headshot multiplier raised to x1.75 (ip from x1.30)
  * Lowered base damage to 80 (down from 85)
  * Reduced Fleshpound damage resistance (50% -> 25%)
  * Up to 4 over-penetrations
* **HK417** magazines made slightly bigger: 15/18 -> 16/20 (base/lv6 Commando)
* **SVD** total ammo increased to 90 (up from 80) due to its heavy weight
  (weight of the inventory item = gun weight + ammo weight)
* Explained the big weight difference between SVD (11kg) and SVDS (7kg) in the item description:
  * SVD is loaded with special sniper rounds 7N1 while SVDS is loaded with regular 7.62x54mmR
  * SVD has 50% more total ammo comparing to SVDS
  * SVDS uses Horzine custom light-weight 5-round magazines
  * The original reason was (and is) "because of the balance"
* **VAL** cost lowered to $2500 (down from $3500) but significantly raised ammo cost
* **VAL** total ammo count raised to 300 (up from 260)
* Fixed "Flarry Men" achievement

### v9.63.15

* **Support Spec.** gains 40% damage resistance while holding a **Chainsaw**
* Revised game hints
* Adjusted spawn inventory and some custom game waves. Make sure to update *ScrnBalanceSrv.ini* and *ScrnWaves.ini*.

### v9.63.12

* **Nailgun** primary fire shoots single nails while the secondary fire - 7-nail pack (thanks [Duckbuster])
* Changed achievement progress display priority: achievements with lower goal value have higher priority to be displayed
* Social Isolation: fixed penalty for coughing in shop  

### v9.63.11

* Fixed a crash on weapon pickup
* Sharpshooter damage bonus with 9mm pistol restored to 40%

### v9.63.10

#### Weapon Balance

* **Handcannon** magazine size reduced down to 7 bullets (+1 in case of a tactical reload)
* **Sharpshooter** gains only 30% faster reload with single pistols, M14, and Musket (down from 60%).
    Reload speed bonus reduce compensates a tactical reload buff.
* LAR and custom sniper rifles (perked weapons) still have 60% faster reload bonus
* Zeds, nailed to a wall with **Nailgun**, receive additional damage on tearing away.
* Player weapon lock applies on spawn invetory too.
* Fixed a bug that allowed a player with full Machete-boost do up to 8K damage (thanks [Joe])

#### Social Isolation

The most used strategy in Social Isolation is "Covidiot Party," i.e., do not care about distance and rely on the medic to heal you (like in real life too ;)).
Made a few changes to make being sick less "pleasant":

* Coughing on already sick players make them coughing more
* Coughing is the shop leads to -$99 penalty for disinfection needs
* Players cannot pick up infected weapons or dosh, even if they are infected too

### v9.63.09

* Players do not spawn with TP in regular games anymore (excluding *Social Isolation*)
* There is no TP in ammo boxes anymore
* New config option `bBlameFart` allows to disable farts

### v9.63.08

* Fixed an exploit that allowed throwing nades at insane rate
* **Claymore** weight raised to 8 (up from 6)
* **Chainsaw** weight lowered to 7 (down from 8)
* **Scythe** primary attack made wider (the widest attack in the Berserker's arsenal);
    secondary attack range made longer (the longest melee range).
    Neither of the attacks can stun Scrakes.
* **Scythe** price raised to 1750 (up from 1500)
* Code cleanup: removed log messages from ScrN Features tab

### v9.63.07

* Machete Boost capped at 150 (down from 250)
* Machete damage scales exponentially according to the boost and player's velocity.
* At the beginning of the wave, weapons on the ground are not destroyed immediately, but in 3 seconds.

### v9.63.06

* Added a safety check to restore weapons in case player gets stuck in `QuickMelee`.
  It should trigger automatically. If not, there is a console command: `FixQuickMelee`
  Now using QuickMelee should be safe.
* QuickMelee is now performed slightly faster
* Machete-sprint speed boost now gets halved every second instead of instantly dropping down to 0, in case of cooldown.

### v9.63.05

* Fixed reloading of the regular Shotgun
* Added more ScrN key bindings to Settings/Controls

### v9.63.04

* Fixed Shotgun headshot detection bug at point-blank range

### v9.63.03

* Fixed **Boomstick** network replication bug (some of many)
* Lowered Boomstick total ammo count from 48 down to 42 (62 -> 54 @ L6)
* Ammo box gives 6 Boomstick shells (down from 10)

#### ScrN Voting Handler v4.06

* Fixed a potential player crash issue
* Fixed an alignment issue when vote value contains color tags

### v9.63.02

#### Weapons

* Reworked **Boomstick** reload. No the reload has 3 phases: open barrels; insert shells; close barrels. Player can
  skip the reload by switching to another gun, throwing nades or Quick Melee in the first and the last phase.
  Reload cannot be skipped in the middle of inserting shells.
  Skipping reload in the phase 1 leaves the weapon unloaded. Next time Boomstick is equipped, the reload gets restarted
  from the beginning.
* Fixed the **Shotgun point-blank penetration bug** that existed from both in ScrN Balance and Vanilla since the very
  beginning. When shooting a zed at point-blank range, pellets did not penetrate the target.
  **This is not the distant spawn bug** where pellets spawn behind the target (and that's why you have to crouch or
  jump when shooting SC, for instance). The latter is still in the game. I can easily fix that but it will break all
  known combos, so I leave it as is.
* **Chainsaw** is now a cross-perk weapon (Berserker + Support Spec.)
* Raised Chainsaw alt fire headshot multiplier to x1.3 (up from x1.2)
* New achievement: *Evil Dead Combo* - Solo-kill 15 Scrakes with Chainsaw + Boomstick without taking damage.

#### Heavy MachineGunner v5.10

From now on, HMG is considered long-range Support.

* Removed ~Heavy AK47~. *Heavy Tommy Gun* is now starting Tier 1 weapon for HMG.
* Significantly raised bullet over-penetration for **RPK47**, **PKM**, and **M249**.
* Added Semi-auto mode for M249 with even higher penetration.
* Lowered M249 DPS and magazine size by ~20% to compensate increased penetration
* Lowered total ammo for RPK47, PKM, and M249.
* Increased M249 weight to 13 (up from 12)
* Lowered **Pat Chaingun** total ammo to 1500 (down from 1800)
* Raised **XMV850** damage from 39 to 45 (62 -> 72 @ L6)

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Fixed *Shotgun point-blank penetration bug* for **Saiga-12** and **SPAS-12**

#### Weapon Blame

Some weapons are considered overpowered, but nerfing them would make them useless. That's why you players can still buy
such weapons, but they get automatically blamed for doing that.
In addition to blame, *Hardcore Level* gets lowered, which, in turn, can prevent players to gain some achievements.
Blaming is done only when buying weapon from The Trader. Picking up those weapons from the ground doesn't blame the
player, neither lowers HL.

The current blame weapon list (applied only on the Boss wave - you can safely buy then in early waves):

* M99 (-1 HL)
* RPG (-4 HL)
* M41A a.k.a. Alien Rifle (-2 HL)

#### Code Changes

* Fixed an issue where spawned `ScrnGameRulesMod` didn't automatically add itself to the mod list.

### v9.63

#### Console Commands

* `WeaponSlot X` / `GunSlot X` moves weapon to slot X, where X is in [1..9] (thanks to [Scuddles])

  Players can bind extra slots like this:

```cpp
set input 6 SwitchWeapon 6
set input NumPad6 WeaponSlot 6
```

  For example, select Boomstick and press NumPad6. Boomstick gets moved from default slot 4 to slot 6.
  Now pressing 6 selects Boostick while leaving slot 4 exclusively for AA12.

#### Ridiculous Stuff

* When player is out of nades, he/she throws toilet paper
* Player drops toilet paper on death
* When blamed, the player farts and "craps out" some toilet paper
* Zeds try to avoid farts for 15 seconds
* Farting limited to once per minute to avoid cheating

#### ScrN Weapon Pack

* Removed the old RPG-7. Renamed the new RPG-7 from `ScrnRPG` to `RPG`.
  Make sure to update *ScrnBalanceServ.ini* and *ServerPerks.ini* to ensure that there is `RPG` and `RPGPickup`
  instead of ~ScrnRPG~ and ~ScrnRPGPickup~ respectively.
* Fixed RPG scope. Now crosshair in the scope matches the iron sights.
* Added Lidar sensor to **RPG**, calculating the distance of the target.
  Currently, the distance is displayed only on the Texture scope.

#### ScrN Zed Pack

* Fixed an issue when **Shiver** could teleport if he did not see the player.
* Added slight randomness in Shiver's teleport cooldown preventing 4-pack squad to teleport at the same time

#### Heavy MachineGunner v5.03

* Rebuilt to comply with the ScrN Balance v9.63

#### Horzine Technician v4.03

* Rebuilt to comply with the ScrN Balance v9.63

#### Code Changes

* Introduced `ScrnGameRulesMod` to allow customization of `ScrnGameRules`
* Introduced `ScrnAchHandlerBase.ApplyGameRules()` to execute once the game rules are found and set
* `ScrnAchCtrl.FindAchievement()` and therefore `ProgressAchievementByID()`, `GetAchievementByID()`, and
  `IsAchievementUnlocked()` are no longer looking for *map* achievements.
  This gives significant performance boost due to excluding 200+ map achievements from the lookup list.
  Use `ScrnMapAchievements.UnlockMapAchievement()` to unlock map achievements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### v9.62.07

#### Social Isolation

* The Virus cannot instantly kill a player with 100hp anymore

* Minimum player count for *Covidiot Party* achievement lowered to 3 (down from 4)
* Fixed an issue where Covidiot achievements were not given if the last infected player was asymptomatic.

#### UI/UX

* *Cool HUD* is disabled by default. New players start with the classic HUD. Cool HUD is still available for selection
  in *ScrN Features* or via console command: `ToggleHudStyle`
* Perked weapon category gets automatically selected and opened on entering shop menu

#### Balance

* Fixed an issue at zed's enemy selection where the zed could see a player behind.
* `bSpawn0` enabled by default (spawn weapons cost nothing, drop all purchased guns on death)

#### Config

* `bUseDLCLocks` disabled by default (all weapons available)
* `DLCLocks` moved to a separate config file: **ScrnLock.ini**
* All default configs converted from UTF-16 to ANSI. Any unicode characters removed.
  Keep in mind that **KF1 engine does NOT support UTF-8**.
  If you put any unicode character in the config, save it in *UTF-16 LE* encoding.
  Saving config in UTF-8 makes it unreadable by the engine.

#### Code Changes

* Removed broken achievement lookup cache
* Added `ScrnVeterancyTypes.RelatedPerkIndex` to identify related perks (e.g., Field and Combat medics)
* Fixed an incorrect player count value at `ScrnPlayerInfo.WaveStarted()`
* Fixed a warning on accessing null `KFGRI` in `ScrnBalance.PostBeginPlay()`

### v9.62.01

#### Social Isolation Mod

[Steam Webpage](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ScrNBalance/discussions/2/4666237625653274273/)

#### ScrN Waves

* New game **60 - Social Isolation**
* New game **61 - Triple Invasion** (Social Isolation + Doom3)
* Fixed an issue when event boss could spawn in non-event games
* Raised Hardcore Level for *Mystery Game*, *Welding Floor*, and *Ammo Hunt*

#### Balance Changes

#### Achievements

* Optimized achievement lookup speed.
* Lowered requirement for *TeamWork: Grilled Shiver Brains* to 50 (down from 250)

#### Code Changes

* Refactored achievement progress handling. All related functions moved to `ScrnAchCtrl` class.
  From now on, custom mutators should use `class'ScrnAchCtrl'.static.RegisterAchievements()` for custom achievement
  registration.
  Legacy functions left in `ScrnAchievements` class but marked deprecated. They will be removed in future.
* Added `ScrnAchHandlerBase.GameEnded()`
* Added `ScrnHumanPawn.bServerShopping` flag that is set during shopping. For example, this flag can be used to
  distinguish weapon purchase from pickup.
* Deprecated `ScrnPlayerInfo.CustomReplicationInfo`

### v9.62.00

#### Features

* Added a proper support for headshot multiplier below 1.
  For instance, if `HeadShotDamageMult=0.3`, then 30% damage goes to the head, the remaining 70% damage the body.

#### ScrN Waves

* `Doom3DisableSuperMonsters` for *ScrnGameLength*. if true, prevents Doom3Mutator from randomly spawning mid-game
  bosses. Use this, if bosses are controlled via ScrnWaves.ini. Requires **ScrnDoom3KF v9.62+**

#### Bug Fix

* Fixed a rare crash due to missing ambient sound for **xbow** and **M99**.

#### Console Commands

* `MUTATE ZED <alias> <index> SPAWN <count>` spawns zed(-s). Requires admin rights.
  Only zeds that are enabled for the current game can be spawned.
  Example: `MUTATE ZED FP 1 SPAWN 5` - spawns 5 Fleshpounds.
* `MUTATE ZED <alias> <index> SUMMON` - similar to spawn, but instead of spawning zed in a *ZombieVolume*, summons it
  in front of the player. Player needs to look at the ground where he wants to summon a zed.  
  **WARNING!** Be extremely cautious when summoning a zed. If you miss the ground, you can summon it outside of the
  map and screw up the entire game. Use summon for debug/test purpose only. `SPAWN` is much safer than `SUMMON`.

#### Code Changes

* Added `MaxHeadHealth` to `ScrnGameRules.MonsterInfo`
* `ScrnFire` base class for instant fire with bullet penetration
* `ScrnHighROFFire` base class for super-fast shooting weapons

#### Heavy MachineGunner v5.00

* Fixed Stinger fire sounds
* Adjusted Stinger 1st person muzzle flash
* Fixed Pat Chaingun bullet tracer
* AUG A1 weight lowered to 8 (down from 9)

  Nightmare Mode (GameLength=9) or any non-Doom non-FTG custom game modes (GameLength in [72..99])
* Fixed bug where MVOTE DIFF sometimes did not work
* Restored `bOtherPlayerLasersBlue` feature. It is not available in GUI yet, but it can be set in *User.ini*

```cpp
  HardcoreLevel=(HL=10)
  HardcoreLevel=(Difficulty=5,HL=15)
  HardcoreLevel=(Difficulty=7,HL=20)
```

  Users should not touch it.

* Added random waves, e.g., `Waves=Wave2a|Wave2b|Wave2c`
* Added `Mutators` to ScrnGameLength.

#### Mutators

From now on, in most cases there is no need to specify any mutators in server command line or KFMapVote.ini.
Any ScrN game type automatically loads ScrnBalance mutator, which in turn loads ServerPerksMut.
Then ScrnBalance loads all mutators listed in `AutoLoadMutators` array (ScrnBalance.ini).
And finally `ScrnGameLength.Mutators` are loaded.

###### Mutator load order (if ScrnBalance is NOT in the server command line)

1. Mutators from the command line (KFMapVote.ini)
2. ServerPerks (`ScrnBalance.ServerPerksPkgName`, default `ScrnSP.ServerPerksMutSE`)
3. `ScrnBalance.AutoLoadMutators`
4. ScrnBalance itself
5. `ScrnGameLength.Mutators`

###### Mutator load order (if ScrnBalance is in the server command line)

1. Mutators from the command line prior to ScrnBalance.
2. ServerPerks (`ScrnBalance.ServerPerksPkgName`, default `ScrnSP.ServerPerksMutSE`)
3. `ScrnBalance.AutoLoadMutators`
4. ScrnBalance itself
5. Mutators from the command line after ScrnBalance
6. `ScrnGameLength.Mutators`

#### Version Numbering Change

Version numbering changed to **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**. No more special BETA releases.
From now on every version is a potential release candidate.

#### Burning Mechanism

* Now flares do not explode. They burn the victim from inside.
* Since regular fire damage burn zeds from outside, both can co-exist, dealing two damages at once:
  burn and flare (iDoT)
* Flares cannot crispify zeds.
* Headshots with flares do increased burn damage (iDoT) comparing to body shots.
* *Flare Revolvers* do x1.5 headshot burn damage; *Protecta* - x3.0.

### v9.53

#### Code Remarks

v9.53 code is the same as v9.52's. The only change it does is **change whitespace from tabs to 4 spaces** to apply
the same standard for the entire source code.

Those who forked the *KF-ScrnBalance* repository should do the following procedure to avoid merge conflicts:

1. Merge `v9.52` **tag** into your branch.
2. Replace tabs with 4 spaces within your code ("\t" -> "    ") and commit changes to your branch.
3. Merge `v9.53` **tag** into your branch. Resolve any conflicts.
4. Merge `master` into your branch.

### v9.52

#### ScrN Waves

###### Ammo Grab Waves

Set `EndRule=RULE_GrabAmmo` to force players looking for ammo boxes. Wave ends when the given amount of ammo boxes are
picked up. Useful to make players replenish their ammo pools without opening the trader.

###### Dosh Grab Waves

Dead zeds drop dosh on the ground instead of adding it to player/team wallet. It is like using _ScrnDoshGrab_ mutator
but those could be only a few waves instead of the entire game. Wave ends when the given amount of dosh is collected.
There are two wave kinds: `RULE_DoshGrab` and `RULE_GrabDoshZed`. The difference between those two is that in
`RULE_GrabDoshZed` **zeds can pick dosh** to heal or boost their health (up to x5 of the original hp).

Dosh drop kind depends from the kill shot:

* Dosh is tossed toward player if killed by a headshot;
* Dosh is thrown up if killed by fire, explosive and other damages that can't do headshots;
* Dosh is "farted out" if killed by bodyshot.

###### Squad Scale

Added "Scale squad members by player count" feature (*Squad Scale*) to squad definition in `ScrnWaveInfo`.
For example, `SpecialSquads=~6: BOSS` means an extra boss will be added for each 6 players starting with 7th (6+1);
health of the **entire squad** will be matched to player count instead of every zed:

* 1 player : 1 boss, 1p hp
* 2 players: 1 boss, 2p hp
* 6 players: 1 boss, 6p hp
* 7 players: 2 bosses, 3.5p hp each
* 8 players: 2 bosses, 4p hp each
* 9 players: 2 bosses, 4.5p hp each
* 10 players: 2 bosses, 5p hp each
* 11 players: 2 bosses, 5.5p hp each
* 12 players: 2 bosses, 6p hp each
* 13 players: 3 bosses, 4.33p hp each (13/3)
* 18 players: 3 bosses, 6p hp each
* 20 players: 4 bosses, 3.33p hp each

*Squad Scale* can be applied for regular squads as well, e.g. `Squad=~3: SC` spawns an extra Scrake
per each 3 players in the team (every Scrake in this case won't have more than 3p health).

###### Other changes

* `BountyScale` now is applied on both player reward and team budget (previously it was applied only on team budget)
* `BountyScale`, in addition, can be set for each wave (overrides game's value)
* Inverted `SpawnRateMod`setting to avoid further confusion. From now on `SpawnRateMod=2.0` means twice *faster* spawns
  while `SpawnRateMod=0.5` - twice *slower*. **Make sure to update ScrnWaves.ini !**
* `bRandomSquads` and `bRandomSpecialSquads` - allows turning off a random component for more predictable game.
* `GameTitle` - games (ScrnGameLength) can have a name now (shown on the scoreboard)

#### TSC: Team Survival Competition

* Killing members of the other team gives $+100
* Killing teammates charges $-100

#### FTG: Follow The Guardian

* The Stinky Clot got raped by a Shiver and now gained an ability to teleport... when stuck

#### Mystery Game

* Wave2, Earn Dosh, split on three: Earn Dosh, Grab Dosh and Zed Grab Dosh.
* Added Ammo Grab wave between Wave 9 and Wave 10.
* Now there are 13 waves in the Mystery Game.
* Balance improvements.

#### (**New**) Half-Long Game

Five-wave game containing 4 latest waves from the Long game and new brand-new introduction wave (Dosh Grab)

#### (**New**) Small Big Zeds

Six-wave game where Big zeds (Husk+) have less health, but there are bigger in numbers. For example, in 6-player
Small Big Zeds game there will be 3 Scrake spawning (each having 2p health) instead of one with 6p health, unlike
in regular game.

#### Bug Fixes

* Yet another attempt to fix client crash while opening ScrN Features tab...

#### Code Remarks

* Reward for killing zed now is calculated from `Monster.ScoringValue` instead of `Monster.default.ScoringValue`.
  This allows customizing rewards per individual zed instead of zed type.
* Added `ScrnGameType.bZedTimeEnabled` flag. This allows custom mutators to disable Zed Time in the game.
* Class `Doom3MonstersCollection` is deleted. `CustomEvents` are no longer supported.

## Gunslinger PERK

New perk supposed to use pistols, especially in Dual mode.
To enable Gunslinger perk you need to add it to the _ServerPerks.ini_.

_"Buying perked duals -> selling offperk"_ exploit fully fixed only in the
ScrN versions of the pistols.

Single pistols are still better in Sharpshooter hands, because he has both base
and perk headshot damage multiplier (up to 140% bonus for level 6).
Gunslinger has only up to 50% damage bonus, but it's applied to the bodyshots
too. Both single and dual 9mm damage bonus is limited to 35%.

Dual pistols are no longer Sharpshooter weapons - he can't level up with them
and doesn't have any damage/reload/recoil bonuses. However, trader discount
bonus is still applied to prohibit potential buying/selling exploits.

Weight modifications were made:

```txt
Dual-9mm        2 blocks
44 Magnum       3 blocks
Dual 44 Magnum  4 blocks
HandCannon      4 blocks
Dual HC         5 blocks
Laser 44 Magnum 5 blocks (new weapon)
```

Because all Gunslinger perk inventory is light-weight, his max carry weight
is limited to 10.

Magnum44 ammo price lowered from 13 to 12 to match HC per-bullet price.
Magnum44 bullet now is slightly cheaper than HC and that is how it's supposed to be.

Dual HC/44 are put in Gunslinger's weapon slot 3. Other perks still will
have them in slot 2. This is made because usually Gunslinger has too many
pistols in slot 2 and it is compilated to switch between them.

### COWBOY MODE

Starting from level 3 Gunslinger can act in Cowboy mode.
Cowboys use only dual pistols, can't wear armor or use laser sights.
Cowboy mode is switching automatically when all the requirements are met.

Cowboy mode grants Gunslinger following bonuses:

* 25% extra reload bonus for each level (up to 75%)
* 5% speed bonus for each next level (up to 20%)
* 10% fire rate bonus for each next level (up to 30%)
