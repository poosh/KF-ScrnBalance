  down to 10% on all difficulties.
  Ammo box can't disappear when seen by player.

    and applies it on-the-fly.
TestQuickMelee - prints weapon states for debug purposes (in case QuickMelee bugs out again).

Quick Melee Bash:
- Vanilla Knife replaced with SE version (ScrnKnife)

  spawn invetory (ScrnBalance.ini). Otherwise Quick Melee won't work.
- Currently Quick Melee Bash is working with Knife SE and Machete SE only
- Assign the following command to a key for melee bash: "Button bAltFire | QuickMelee"
- Console command to assign thumb mouse button for melee bash:
    SET INPUT Mouse4 Button bAltFire | QuickMelee
  or via user.ini:
    Mouse4=Button bAltFire | QuickMelee

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--=Gunslinger PERK=--
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New perk supposed to use pistols, especially in Dual mode.
(i) To enable Gunslinger perk you need to add it to the ServerPerks.ini.
(i) "Buying perked duals -> selling offperk" exploit fully fixed only in the
    Scrn versions of the pistols.

Single pistols are still better in Sharpshooter hands, because he has both base
and perk headshot damage multiplier (up to 140% bonus for level 6).
Gunslinger has only up to 50% damage bonus, but it's applied to the bodyshots
too. Both single and dual 9mm damage bonus is limited to 35%.

Dual pistols are no longer Sharpshooter weapons - he can't level up with them
and doesn't have any damage/reload/recoil bonuses. However, trader discount
bonus is still applied to prohibit potential buying/selling exploits.

Weight modifications were made:
Dual-9mm        2 blocks
44 Magnum       3 blocks
Dual 44 Magnum  4 blocks
HandCannon      4 blocks
Dual HC         5 blocks
Laser 44 Magnum 5 blocks (new weapon)
Because all Gunslinger perk inventory is light-weight, his max carry weight
is limited to 10.

Magnum44 ammo price lowered from 13 to 12 to match HC per-bullet price.
Magnum44 bullet now is slightly cheaper than HC and that is how it's supposed to be.

Dual HC/44 are put in Gunslinger's weapon slot 3. Other perks still will
have them in slot 2. This is made because usually Gunslinger has too many
pistols in slot 2 and it is compilated to switch between them.

COWBOY MODE
Starting from level 3 Gunslinger can act in Cowboy mode.
Cowboys use only dual pistols, can't wear armor or use laser sights.
Cowboy mode is switching automatically when all the requirements are met.

Cowboy mode grants Gunslinger following bonuses:
25% extra reload bonus for each level (up to 75%)
5% speed bonus for each next level (up to 20%)
10% fire rate bonus for each next level (up to 30%)
