<p>From now on, in most cases there is no need to specify any mutators in server command line or KFMapVote.ini.
Any ScrN game type automatically loads ScrnBalance mutator, which in turn loads ServerPerksMut.
Then ScrnBalance loads all mutators listed in <code>AutoLoadMutators</code> array (ScrnBalance.ini).
And finally <code>ScrnGameLength.Mutators</code> are loaded.</p>
<h6>Mutator load order (if ScrnBalance is NOT in the server command line):</h6>
<ol>
<li>Mutators from the command line (KFMapVote.ini)</li>
<li>ServerPerks (<code>ScrnBalance.ServerPerksPkgName</code>, default <code>ScrnSP.ServerPerksMutSE</code>)</li>
<li><code>ScrnBalance.AutoLoadMutators</code></li>
<li>ScrnBalance itself</li>
<li><code>ScrnGameLength.Mutators</code></li>
</ol>
<h6>Mutator load order (if ScrnBalance is in the server command line):</h6>

<li>Mutators from the command line prior to ScrnBalance.</li>
<li>ServerPerks (<code>ScrnBalance.ServerPerksPkgName</code>, default <code>ScrnSP.ServerPerksMutSE</code>)</li>
<li><code>ScrnBalance.AutoLoadMutators</code></li>
<li>ScrnBalance itself</li>

the same standard for the entire source code.</p>

</ol>
<h3>v9.52</h3>
<h4>ScrN Waves</h4>
<h6>Ammo Grab Waves</h6>
<p>Set <code>EndRule=RULE_GrabAmmo</code> to force players looking for ammo boxes. Wave ends when the given amount of ammo boxes are
picked up. Useful to make players replenish their ammo pools without opening the trader.</p>
<h6>Dosh Grab Waves</h6>
<p>Dead zeds drop dosh on the ground instead of adding it to player/team wallet. It is like using <em>ScrnDoshGrab</em> mutator
but those could be only a few waves instead of the entire game. Wave ends when the given amount of dosh is collected.
There are two wave kinds: <code>RULE_DoshGrab</code> and <code>RULE_GrabDoshZed</code>. The difference between those two is that in
<code>RULE_GrabDoshZed</code> <strong>zeds can pick dosh</strong> to heal or boost their health (up to x5 of the original hp).</p>
<p>Dosh drop kind depends from the kill shot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dosh is tossed toward player if killed by a headshot;</li>
<li>Dosh is thrown up if killed by fire, explosive and other damages that can't do headshots;</li>
<li>Dosh is &quot;farted out&quot; if killed by bodyshot.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Squad Scale</h6>
<p>Added &quot;Scale squad members by player count&quot; feature (<em>Squad Scale</em>) to squad definition in <code>ScrnWaveInfo</code>.
For example, <code>SpecialSquads=~6: BOSS</code> means an extra boss will be added for each 6 players starting with 7th (6+1);
health of the <strong>entire squad</strong> will be matched to player count instead of every zed:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 player : 1 boss, 1p hp</li>
<li>2 players: 1 boss, 2p hp</li>
<li>6 players: 1 boss, 6p hp</li>
<li>7 players: 2 bosses, 3.5p hp each</li>
<li>8 players: 2 bosses, 4p hp each</li>
<li>9 players: 2 bosses, 4.5p hp each</li>
<li>10 players: 2 bosses, 5p hp each</li>
<li>11 players: 2 bosses, 5.5p hp each</li>
<li>12 players: 2 bosses, 6p hp each</li>
<li>13 players: 3 bosses, 4.33p hp each (13/3)</li>
<li>18 players: 3 bosses, 6p hp each</li>
<li>20 players: 4 bosses, 3.33p hp each</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Squad Scale</em> can be applied for regular squads as well, e.g. <code>Squad=~3: SC</code> spawns an extra Scrake
per each 3 players in the team (every Scrake in this case won't have more than 3p health).</p>
<h6>Other changes</h6>
<ul>
<li><code>BountyScale</code> now is applied on both player reward and team budget (previously it was applied only on team budget)</li>
<li><code>BountyScale</code>, in addition, can be set for each wave (overrides game's value)</li>
<li>Inverted <code>SpawnRateMod</code>setting to avoid further confusion. From now on <code>SpawnRateMod=2.0</code> means twice <em>faster</em> spawns
while <code>SpawnRateMod=0.5</code> - twice <em>slower</em>. <strong>Make sure to update ScrnWaves.ini !</strong></li>
<li><code>bRandomSquads</code> and <code>bRandomSpecialSquads</code> - allows turning off a random component for more predictable game.</li>
<li><code>GameTitle</code> - games (ScrnGameLength) can have a name now (shown on the scoreboard)</li>
</ul>
<h4>TSC: Team Survival Competition</h4>

</ul>
<h4>(<strong>New</strong>) Half-Long Game</h4>
<p>Five-wave game containing 4 latest waves from the Long game and new brand-new introduction wave (Dosh Grab)</p>
<h4>(<strong>New</strong>) Small Big Zeds</h4>
<p>Six-wave game where Big zeds (Husk+) have less health, but there are bigger in numbers. For example, in 6-player
Small Big Zeds game there will be 3 Scrake spawning (each having 2p health) instead of one with 6p health, unlike
in regular game.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>v9.10</h3>
<ul>
<li>MACHETE-SPRINTING. Dropping/Picking up machete while running boosts player's
movement speed and machete's damage.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Great Pyramid - Arena</li>

<li>MUTATE MAPZEDS automatically forces new max-zeds-at-once value.
No need to enter two commands anymore (MUTATE FORCEZEDS command removed).</li>
<li>Fixed QuickMelee bug when it hid current weapon</li>
<li>Added TestQuickMelee console command to print weapon state into both console and log</li>

During the trader time and when last 10-20 zeds left, ammo box count drops
down to 10% on all difficulties.
Ammo box can't disappear when seen by player.
When ammo box is picked up, another one spawns somewhere on the map in 5..30s
(cooldown depends from player count)
MUTATE DEBUGPICKUPS shows information about currently spawned ammo boxes</li>
<li>[ScrnSP] - fixed downloading &quot;None.txt&quot; from FTP on map change.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Console Commands:</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>MUTATE HELP</code> - prints all MUTATE commands supported by ScrN Balance</li>
<li><code>MUTATE MAPZEDS</code> - changed behavior. When entered command without value, it just prints current

and applies it on-the-fly.</li>

</ul>
<h4>CONFIG VARIABLES (ScrnBalance.ini):</h4>

Dosh is restored only if bLeaveCashOnDisconnect=False. Otherwise it goes into team budget.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

to stop spamming regular players with FTP codes while continue debugging.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quick Melee Bash:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vanilla Knife replaced with SE version (ScrnKnife)</li>

<h2>Gunslinger PERK</h2>
<p>New perk supposed to use pistols, especially in Dual mode.
To enable Gunslinger perk you need to add it to the <em>ServerPerks.ini</em>.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Buying perked duals -&gt; selling offperk&quot;</em> exploit fully fixed only in the
ScrN versions of the pistols.</p>
<p>Single pistols are still better in Sharpshooter hands, because he has both base
and perk headshot damage multiplier (up to 140% bonus for level 6).
Gunslinger has only up to 50% damage bonus, but it's applied to the bodyshots
too. Both single and dual 9mm damage bonus is limited to 35%.</p>
<p>Dual pistols are no longer Sharpshooter weapons - he can't level up with them
and doesn't have any damage/reload/recoil bonuses. However, trader discount
bonus is still applied to prohibit potential buying/selling exploits.</p>
<p>Weight modifications were made:</p>
<pre><code>Dual-9mm        2 blocks
44 Magnum       3 blocks
Dual 44 Magnum  4 blocks
HandCannon      4 blocks
Dual HC         5 blocks
Laser 44 Magnum 5 blocks (new weapon)
</code></pre>
<p>Because all Gunslinger perk inventory is light-weight, his max carry weight
is limited to 10.</p>
<p>Magnum44 ammo price lowered from 13 to 12 to match HC per-bullet price.
Magnum44 bullet now is slightly cheaper than HC and that is how it's supposed to be.</p>
<p>Dual HC/44 are put in Gunslinger's weapon slot 3. Other perks still will
have them in slot 2. This is made because usually Gunslinger has too many
pistols in slot 2 and it is compilated to switch between them.</p>
<h3>COWBOY MODE</h3>
<p>Starting from level 3 Gunslinger can act in Cowboy mode.
Cowboys use only dual pistols, can't wear armor or use laser sights.
Cowboy mode is switching automatically when all the requirements are met.</p>
<p>Cowboy mode grants Gunslinger following bonuses:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% extra reload bonus for each level (up to 75%)</li>
<li>5% speed bonus for each next level (up to 20%)</li>
<li>10% fire rate bonus for each next level (up to 30%)</li>
</ul>
