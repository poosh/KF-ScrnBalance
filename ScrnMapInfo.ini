# General Settings:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MaxZombiesOnce    Max numbers of specimens, which can exist on the map at the same time.
#                   Default=0 - use default setting. Cannot be set below 16.
# WaveSpawnPeriod   Number of seconds between zed squad spawns. Base value that will get modified by various settings.
#                   Default=0 - use KFLevelRules.WaveSpawnPeriod from the map.
# XPBonusMult       End game bonus multiplier for winning the map.
#                   Default=1.0
#                   Set it to 0..1.0 for eaasier maps and > 1.0 for harder ones.
# ZedEventNum       Force event zeds for this map. See bForceEvent in ScrnBalanceSrv.ini for details.
#                   Default=0 - do not force the event.
#                   This value is ignored if either:
#                       - bForceEvent=False or EvenNum>0 in ScrnBalanceSrv.ini
#                       - bAllowZedEvents=false in ScrnGames.ini
# bTestMap          Set it to true if this is a test map. Test maps block achievement progress but allow extra
#                   privileges to non-admin players like spawning zeds via MUTATE ZED FP SPAWN or always perk changing.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Zed Spawn / ZombieVolume Control (requires ScrnGameType or descendants (TSC, FTG, etc.))
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ZVolDisableTime   Time in seconds to disable a zombie volume for if a player sees or enters it.
#                   Default = 10, meaning that zeds cannot spawn in the volume at least for 10s after the last time
#                   a player saw it. Keep in mind that every ZombieVolume has TouchDisableTime property which means
#                   the same. The game uses max value, i.e., max(ZVolDisableTime, ZombieVolume.TouchDisableTime)
# ZedSpawnMaxDist   Maximum RECOMMENDED distance from players to spawn zeds (+600uu).
#                   When choosing a zombie volume to spawn zeds, the distance to player(-s) is used for volume rating.
#                   Minimum distance is 600uu (12m). ZedSpawnMaxDist is the value beyond the minimum.
#                   1 KF meter = 50uu, which realistically is wrong unless all players are dwarfs.
#                   Default = 2000, meaning that most zeds will spawn 600-2600uu or 12-52m away from the players.
#                   The minimum distance cannot be configured - it may change from various game aspects,
#                   e.g., spawn intensity or MVOTE BORING.
#                   Within the minumum distance (12m by default) distance rating is always 100%.
#                   Then it starts linearly decrease down to 0% at ZedSpawnMaxDist (and may go negative too)
#                   For example, zombie volume in 20m (1000uu) from the players gets rating:
#                   100% - (1000 - 600) / 2000 = 80%
#                   or at 32m (1600uu): 100% - (1600 - 600) / 2000 = 50%
#                   Zed volume with the best rating gets chosen for the next zed spawn, but beside distance, there are
#                   other rating parameters, such as spawn cooldown, game settings, RNG, etc.
# FloorHeight       The height of one floor in multi-floor buildings.
#                   Default = 256 (uu)
#          Pro-Tip: A proper way to calculate FloorHeight is taking two path nodes on subsequent floors
#                   and subtracting their Location.Z values.
# ElevatedSpawnMinZ Allows fine-tuning minumum and maximum Z distance between ZVolElevated and the player.
# ElevatedSpawnMaxZ By default, if not set (0), ElevatedSpawnMinZ=FloorHeight/2, and ElevatedSpawnMaxZ=FloorHeight*2.
# FloorPenalty      FloorPenalty affect the distance rating if the player is not on the same floor as the zombie volume.
#                   Default = 0.30 - meaning 30% of distance rating reduction for volumes on different floors.
#                   "On a different floor" means Z difference between the player and volume > FloorHeight.
#                   Otherwise, floor penalty is applied proportionally to Z difference (ZDif/FloorPenalty)
#          Pro-Tip: Increase FloorPenalty on maps where it is hard/slow to get from one floor to another (Offices).
#                   Decrease FloorPenalty if getting higher is quote easy (HillbillyHorror) or there are there are
#                   "holes" in between. For instance, containers on FrightYard - if players are camping on top of a
#                   container, then spawning zeds on another container away from it (but on "the same floor") is
#                   counter-productive, since zeds need to get down first, then get up to the player's container.
#                   Spawning zeds closer but on the lower ground ("different floor") makes them get to players faster.
#                   Set FloorHeight=0 for single-floor levels. There still be major Z differences but no multi-floor
#                   buildings, undergrounds, etc. For instance, WestLondon is a single floor map. while there are
#                   tunnes, players cannot walk only though the tunnet, not abovve it (i.e., single floor from the
#                   player perspective.). And there is nothing above the police underground.
#                   However, the same cannot be aplied on Wyre, which has an underground system under the hill.
# bHighGround       Prefers spawning on high ground over the low ground. If enabled, FloorPenalty gets applied only
#                   on zombie volumes BELOW the players, not vice versa.
#                   Default = false, meaning that FloorPenalty gets applied in both ways.
#                   WARNING! bHighGround=yes resets all zombie volumes to bNoZAxisDistPenalty=false. However, you can
#                   restore the flag by adding low-ground volumes to ZVolJumpable if there is an easy path to a
#                   high ground from there.
#          Pro-Tip: Enable bHighGround only if ALL higher zombie volumes within ZedSpawnMaxDist have easy/fast access
#                   to the players. If there are a few exceptions (like a spawn on top of the elevator shaft dropping
#                   zeds down to a basement), you can disable those volumes by adding to ZVolBad.
# bResetSpawnDesirability - each zombie volume has SpawnDesirability rating, 3000 by default (a random nonsense number)
#                   Level designers can modify SpawnDesirability to boost or lower spawns in specific volumes.
#                   Which would make sense if they know what they are doing (but they usually don't).
#                   Set bResetSpawnDesirability=true to set the default SpawnDesirability=3000 to all zombie volumes.
# ZVolBad           List of bad zombie volumes which are either broken (zed gets stuck there)
#                   or stupid (e.g., spawn in front of players).
#                   ScrnGameType does not spawn zeds in bad volumes.
# ZVolHidden        List of zombie volumes that are hidden from players: players cannot see, neither reach them.
#                   Usually, those volumes are placed behind a barricate around a corner to simulate zed invasion from
#                   the outer world (outside the map). Such volumes need bAllowPlainSightSpawns=True to be set.
#                   Unfortunately, lazy level designers do not bother with setting bAllowPlainSightSpawns flag.
#                   Adding a zombie volume to ZVolHidden forces its bAllowPlainSightSpawns=True, which has two benefits:
#                   1. Reduces server CPU load by eliminating visibility checks.
#                   2. Bypasses MinDistanceToPlayer check - prevent players from blocking spawns by standing nearby.
#                   Remember that those volumes are meant to be entry points from the outside world,
#                   not the on-the-map shortcut spawns.
#                   WARNING! Must be absolutely sure that players cannot see hidden volumes from any viewing angle.
# ZVolElevated      These spawns are elevated from the ground in unreachable by players places (roof, ceiling, vents...)
#                   Marking them elevated removes Z distance check in volume rating (sets bNoZAxisDistPenalty=true),
#                   while requiring the player to be BELOW the volume. Elevated spawns are not used if the player is
#                   above or at the same Z position as the volume. For example, the bottom floor vent spawn on
#                   BioticsLab (ZombieVolume2) is one of the closest to the start (XY-wise), and was picked very often,
#                   desptite having one of the longest path to the map start. Adding it to ZVolElevated fixes the issues,
#                   making zeds spawn there only if players are on the bottom floor.
#                   Elevated spawn is NOT used if the player is TWO or MORE FLOORS beneath it (2*FloorHeight)
# ZVolJumpable      Similar to ZVolElevated but without the high ground requirement. Sets bNoZAxisDistPenalty=true.
#                   Use it instead of elevated if there is a jump spot nearby, or other easy access to upper levels.
#                   Jumpable volumes completely ignore Z axis in distance calculation.
# ZVolDoors         Prevents spawning zeds in a volume, if the specified doors (KFDoorMover actors) are welded.
#                   A classic example: the start on BioticsLab. If both doors on the left and right are welded, then
#                   there is no place for zeds to come from. Nonetheless, they do spawn if players move slightly forward
#                   and break LoS.
#                   Rule of thumb: if there is a door between a hidden spawn(-s) and the current one,
#                   add it to ZVolDoors. Maybe it slightly slowers the spawn rate, but improves immersion.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Stinky Clot Control (FTG-only)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GuardianLight     Allows adjusting light  brightness of TSC/FTG Base Guardian.
#                   Default = 0 - keep the default brightness (150). Value range: 0..255.
# FTGTargetsPerWave Number of targets (usually, ammo boxes) for Stinky Clot to visit before going to the trader.
#                   Default=3. Increase for smaller maps (where reaching targets is faster)l decrease for big maps.
#                   Setting FTGTargetsPerWave does not limit Stinky's ability to spawn ammo boxes on its way.
#                   For instance, there could be only one target, but 5 ammo boxes on the way. Stinky will spawn all 5.
#                   FTGTargetsPerWave is ignored if the next wave has no trader.
# FTGBadAmmo        List of bad targets (KFAmmoPickup objects) where Stinky Clot gets stuck or behaves weird.
#                   FTG makes sure that Stinky Clot will never pick a bad target as a walk destination.
#                   However, he may still get there unintentionally if the target is on the way while moving elsewhere.
# FTGTargets        A list of navigation points (PathNode, Teleporter, PlayerStart, etc.) for Stinky Clot to navigate.
#                   If the map has way too little ammo boxes, or there are interesting places to visit without ammo
#                   boxes, you may add it to FTGTargets.
# bReplaceFTGTargets if true, completely replaces all ammo box targets with the ones defined in FTGTargets.
#                   Default = false, meaning that FTGTargets get added to the existing lists of ammo boxes.
# FTGPaths          Allows redirecting paths for Stinky Clot by adding a path node(-s) in-between. For example:
#                       FTGPaths=(From=PathNode10,To=PathNode20,Via[0]=PathNode1,Via[1]=PathNode2,Via[2]=PathNode3)
#                   ensures that Stinky Clot does not go from PathNode10 straightly to PathNode20, but goes:
#                       PathNode10 => PathNode1 => PathNode2 => PathNode3 => PathNode20
#                   Paths are NOT BIDIRECTIONAL, i.e., in the above example Stinky Clot will still go from PathNode20
#                   back to PathNode10 directly. Though, you can add the opposite path manually:
#                       FTGPaths=(From=PathNode20,To=PathNode10,Via[0]=PathNode3,Via[1]=PathNode2,Via[2]=PathNode1)
#                   It is also possible to define different paths for opposite directions:
#                       FTGPaths=(From=PathNode10,To=PathNode20,Via[0]=PathNode5)
#                       FTGPaths=(From=PathNode20,To=PathNode10,Via[0]=PathNode6)
#                   Multipath or recursive paths are NOT supported. You can set up to 3 intermediate (Via) path nodes.
#                   Generic paths are possible, where you set only one of (From,To) values.
#                   The next example makes sure that Stinky Clot goes to PathNode5, then PathNode6, every time he
#                   departs from PathNode10 - no matter of the target destination:
#                       FTGPaths=(From=PathNode10,Via[0]=PathNode5,Via[1]=PathNode6)
#                   Stinky Clot visits PathNode6 => PathNode7 => PathNode8 before going to PathNode20:
#                       FTGPaths=(To=PathNode20,Via[0]=PathNode6,Via[1]=PathNode7,Via[1]=PathNode8)
#                   Stinky Clot is smart enough to combine both the above example together when going from
#                   PathNode10 to PathNode20:
#                       PathNode10 => PathNode5 => PathNode6 => PathNode7 => PathNode8 => PathNode20
#                   Specific paths (that have both From+To) have higher priority than the generic ones.
#                   In the next example, Stinky usualy leaves PathNode30 via PathNode31, except when he travels
#                   to PathNode40, where he goes via PathNode50 instead.
#                       FTGPaths=(From=PathNode30,Via[0]=PathNode31)
#                       FTGPaths=(From=PathNode30,To=PathNode40,Via[0]=PathNode50)
#          Pro-Tip: Actually, KFAmmoPickup never is a Stinky Clot's direct target - he moves to the closest visible
#                   path node instead. Set bDebugStinkyPath=True under [ScrnBalanceSrv.FtgGame] in KillingFloor.ini
#                   to log the actual paths.
