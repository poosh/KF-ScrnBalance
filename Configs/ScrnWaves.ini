##############################################################################
# Wave definition objects that are used in [X ScrnGameLength].Waves (ScrnGames.ini)
# Each wave starts with Trader Time, but there is an option to keep shop closed.
# For example, you can set 10-second cooldown between two waves without shopping.
#
# ScrnWaveInfo objects have the following fields:
# GameVersion - Allows version tracking and sync between ScrnGames.ini and ScrnWaves.ini.
#   On game load, game's version gets compared with the first wave's version (ScrnWaves).
#   If those differ, players receive out-of-sync warning.
#   Integer number in 1/100 units, i.e., "GameVersion=123" means "v1.23"
#   This field is valid only for the first wave.
# Header - text to replace "NEXT WAVE INBOUND" message. If empty, the default text is used.
#   Set to "-" to clear the line.
# Title - Wave title that is shown on the Scoreboard and in "NEXT WAVE INBOUND" message.
#   Set to "-" to clear the line.
# Message - Wave introduction message that along with Title is shown on the Scoreboard and
#   in "NEXT WAVE INBOUND" message.
# TraderMessage - message that Trader says at the start of the Trader Time.
#   Note that each wave starts with the Trader Time.
# TraderDialogues - Story dialogues to trigger at the start of the Trader Time. See DIALOG FORMAT below.
# CompatDialogues - Story dialogues to trigger when combat begins (Trader Time ends).
# FtgDialogues - (FTG only) Story dialogues to trigger when the Stinky Clot grabs the base.
# TraderTime (default = 60) - cooldown before start of the wave.
# bOpenTrader (default = True) - set it to False to disable shopping between waves.
#   All remaining zeds are auto-killed when Trader Doors open.
# bRespawnDeadPlayers (dafault = true) - respawn or not dead players at the beginning of the wave.
# bTraderArrow (default = True) - shows the trader arrow. Trader arrow is always shown during the
#   trader time if bOpenTrader=True. In all other cases bTraderArrow is taken into account.
# bStartAtTrader (default = False) - players spawn next to the trader instead of player start.
# DoorControl (default = DOOR_Default) - control doors at the beginning of the Trader Time or Cooldown.
#   DOOR_Default - Respawn all doors or leave them as is, depending from ScrnBalance configuration
#   DOOR_Respawn - Respawn all doors on the map
#   DOOR_Blow - Blow up all doors on the map
#   DOOR_Unweld - Unweld healthy doors on the map, don't touch blown doors
#   DOOR_UnweldRespawn - Unweld welded doors, respawn blown doors
#   DOOR_Weld1p - Weld all doors to 1%, respawn blown doors
#   DOOR_WeldHalf - Weld all doors to 50%, respawn blown doors
#   DOOR_WeldFull - Weld all doors to 100%, respawn blown doors
#   DOOR_WeldRandom - Weld all doors to random percent, respawn blown doors
#   DOOR_Randomize - Randomly welds, unwelds, respawns or blows doors
# DoorControl2 (default = DOOR_Default) - control doors at the beginning of the battle wave (after the Trader Time)
#
# SuicideTime (default = 0) - time to set/add to Suicide Timer (see ScrnGames.ini for details). If set, overrides
#   game's SuicideTimePerWave
# SuicideTimePerPlayerMult (default = 0.0) - additional SuicideTime per player above 1. Formula:
#   FinalSuicideTime = SuicideTime + SuicideTime * SuicideTimePerPlayerMult * (PlayerCount - 1)
# bSuicideTimeReset (default = false) - reset suicide timer to the SuicideTime value (true), or add SuicideTime to the
#   global timer (false)
#
# EndRule (default = RULE_KillEmAll) - determines a type of the wave:
#   RULE_KillEmAll - classic KF wave which ends when all zeds are dead.
#   RULE_SpawnEmAll - wave ends when all zeds are spawned. Use this to transition
#       between waves without trader time and keep the battle pace
#       (prevent endless kiting of last Clot).
#   RULE_Timeout - wave ends at a specific time no matter of how many zeds were killed.
#   RULE_EarnDosh - wave ends when team earns a specific amount of dosh in Team Budget.
#   RULE_KillBoss - use this for end game boss wave. For mid-game boss use RULE_KillEmAll or RULE_KillSpecial.
#   RULE_GrabDosh - dosh are dropping from dead zeds. Grab it while it's hot!
#   RULE_GrabDoshZed - same as RULE_GrabDosh, but zeds can grab dosh as well (boost their health)
#   RULE_GrabAmmo - players have to look for ammo boxes to finish a wave
#   RULE_KillSpecial - wave ends when every member of the special squad is killed.
#       Use this for mid-game boss if the wave must be ended after the boss death (not all zeds killed).
#       Only one special squad gets spawned - all members of which are treated as bosses.
#       You can still define multiple SpecialSquads with bRandomSpecialSquads=true - to randomly pick the one.
#       ZedsPerSpecialSquad is ignored, but ZedsBeforeSpecialSquad still can be used to delay the boss spawn.
#   RULE_ReachTrader - wave ends when players reach the trader. The destination is set to the first trader teleporter.
#       If the map doesn't have trader teleporters, the wave falls back to RULE_Timeout.
#
# Counter - wave counter; value depends from EndRule:
#   RULE_KillEmAll, RULE_SpawnEmAll, RULE_KillBoss - amount of zeds in wave (solo, Normal diff.)
#       Scaled according to default KF rules for player count and game difficulty, if PerPlayerMult=0.
#       otherwise scaled by PerPlayerMult.
#   RULE_Timeout - time in seconds. Not scaled by the difficulty.
#   RULE_EarnDosh, RULE_GrabDosh, RULE_GrabDoshZed - dosh in Team Budget. Not scaled by the difficulty.
#   RULE_GrabAmmo - ammo box count to be collected by the team. Not scaled by the difficulty.
#   RULE_KillSpecial - not used. Wave counter is the size of the SpecialSquad.
#   RULE_ReachTrader - when the first player reaches the trader, RULE_Timeout triggers with the given counter.
#       PlayerCount in this case counts alive players that are NOT reached the trader yet.
#       When all players reach the trader, the timeout gets skipped.
#   RULE_Dialogue - wait until CombatDialogues end. Players may MVOTE END WAVE to skip the dialogues.
# PerPlayerMult - used when player count > PerPlayerExclude.
#   Formula: WaveCounter = Counter + Counter * PerPlayerMult * (PlayerCount - PerPlayerExclude)
# PerPlayerExclude (default = 1) - player count to exclude in PerPlayerMult calculation.
#   For example, if Counter=100, PerPlayerMult=25, PerPlayerExclude=3, the wave counter stays at 100 up to 3 players,
#   then gets +25 per each player above 3 (125 for 4p, 150 for 5p, etc.)
# MaxCounter - maximum value for scaled counter (if player count is way too big)
#   PerPlayerMult, PerPlayerExclude, and MaxCounter apply to ZedsBeforeSpecialSquad too.
# Timelimit (default = 0, min = 30) - time in seconds to force the wave end, even if the EndRule hasn't been achieved.
#   Use it only as a safety switch, since players are unaware of its existence.
#   0 - disabled.
#
# FtgRule - a special wave rule for FTG games:
#   FTG_Standard (default) - standard FTG wave
#   FTG_NoStinky - no Stinky Clot is spawned. Players need to hold the same spot for the entire wave.
#   FTG_TSCBase - FTG_NoStinky + TSC base rules. Players are allowed to lose the base (and play with Friendly Fire)
#   FTG_NoBase - no Stinky, no base, no friendly fire. A regular survival wave.
#
# SpawnRateMod (default = 1.0) - allows boosting or slowing down zed spawning rate.
#   Valid range: [0.1 .. 10.0]
#   5.0 - 5x faster spawns (time between spawns * 0.2)
#   2.0 - twice faster spawns (time between spawns * 0.5)
#   1.0 - normal speed
#   0.5 - twice slower spawns (time between spawns * 2.0)
# SpecialSquadCooldown (default = 3.0) - an additional cooldown (in seconds) after spawning a special squad.
#   Gives players slight break to deal with the spawned special squad.
#   SpecialSquadCooldown gets DOUBLED in mid-wave if there are enough zeds spawned already.
#
# MaxZombiesOnce - Max numbers of specimens, which can exist on the map at the same time.
#   Overrides ScrnBalance.MaxZombiesOnce for the given wave. The value is NOT kept for next waves.
#   If MaxZombiesOnce is not set or set to 0, then ScrnBalance.MaxZombiesOnce will be used.
# BountyScale - Game's BountyScale override for a wave. Default 0.0 - no override.
# bNoBounty (default = false) - if true, players do not get dosh from killing zeds.
# NoBountyTimeout (default = 0) - delay bNoBounty for the given amount of seconds. Overrides bNoBounty.
#   Use it in RULE_GrabAmmo or RULE_ReachTrader to prevent players from delaying the game to farm dosh.
# CashBonus (default = 0) - Additional cash bonus to give to each player (dead or alive) at the end of the wave.
#   CashBonus is the only dosh that players get if bNoBounty=true.
# XP_Bonus - grants XP bonus for completing the wave. Acts similar to EndGameStatBonus in ScrnBalanceSrv.ini.
#   XP_Bonus is a multiplier of all XP that player gained during the game or from previous XP bonus.
#   Warning! Granting XP_Bonus resets the XP stats for calculation of EndGameStatBonus.
#   0.00 (default) - no bonus
#   0.50 - 50% XP Bonus
#   1.00 - 100% XP Bonus
#   2.00 - 200% XP Bonus
# XP_BonusAlive - XP Bonus for players who survived the wave. If not set, XP_Bonus is used.
#   If both XP_Bonus and XP_BonusAlive are set, then XP_Bonus is granted for dead players but XP_BonusAlive - for alive.
#
# SpecialSquadHealthMod (default = 1.0) - scales both body and head health of zeds in SpecialSquads
# ZedsBeforeSpecialSquad (default = 0) - how many regular zeds to spawn before the first Special Squad in the wave.
#   Scaled by PerPlayerMult (like Counter)
# ZedsPerSpecialSquad - regular zeds to be spawned between next Special Squad is thrown.
#   Both ZedsBeforeSpecialSquad and ZedsPerSpecialSquad are randomized +/-15% unless bRandomSquads=false.
# SpecialSquads - special squad definitions.
# Squads - regular squad definition.
# bRandomSquads (default = true) - randomizes squad order and spawn intervals.
#   If false, squads will be spawned in the listed order and constant cooldown between spawns.
# bRandomSpecialSquads (default = true) - randomizes special squads. Does NOT affect spawn cooldowns.
# bRandomSpawnLoc (default = false) - spawns zeds randomly on the entire map instead of spawning them close to players.
#   Enabling bRandomSpawnLoc disables bFastTrack (ScrnMapInfo.ini)
#   bRandomSpawnLoc has not effect in FTG (where it automatically gets enabled when Stinky picks up the base).
# bForceFastTrack (default = false) - always forces bFastTrack=true (including FTG or Boss waves).
#   This setting has the highest priority.
# bMoreAmmoBoxes (default = false) - spawns more ammo boxes on the map. Always enabled when RULE_GrabAmmo.
#
# *** SPECIAL SQUADS ***
# Special squad is spawned at the start of each wave and then after every
# ZedsPerSpecialSquad amount of zeds. Special squad definition are the same as regular.
# Usually big zeds (FP) are put into special squads to do a heavy pressure on a player team.
# If there are multiple special squads defined, then random squad is picked.
#
# *** SQUAD DEFINITION ***
# Squads=[^] [<MinPlayers>[-<MaxPlayers>:] <SquadMember> [+ <SquadMember>...]
#   or:
# Squads=[^] ~<SquadScale>: <SquadMember> [+ <SquadMember>...]
#   where:
# ^ - keep with above. The squad is always picked after the previous one. Allows keeping squad patterns in random waves.
#   Using on the first squad makes it spawn first even if bRandomSquads=true.
#
# MinPlayers - min required numbers of players in the team. Squad won't be used if player count is less that this value.
# MaxPlayers - max number of players in the team for this squad to be used.
# SquadMember:
#   [<n>*]<alias>[/<fallback>...]
#   , where :
#   n - zed count
#   alias - zed alias (defined in [ScrnZedInfo] object)
#   or "|" - squad split. Splits squad, each part spawning in a different ZombieVolume.
#       For example, "4*FP" or "FP + FP + FP + FP" - spawns four FP, usually in the same place.
#       However, "FP | FP | FP | FP" - spawns four FP, each in different places
#   fallback - another zed alias to be spawned instead if original alias is disabled
# Examples:
# Squads=BL                             # Squad contains one Bloat
# Squads=^ 2*SI                         # Squad contains two sirens, always spawned after Bloat (the squad above)
# Squads=2*CL + BL                      # 2 Clots + 1 Bloat
# Squads=6: 2*FP                        # (squad is used only on 6+ player games): 2 Fleshpounds
# Squads=1-5: FP                        # (squad is used only in 1-5 player games: 1 Fleshpound
# Squads=TH/HU + 2*GF                   # Tesla Husk + 2 Gorefasts. If TH is disabled, Husk is used instead.
# Squads=BR + 2*HU                      # Brute + 2 Husks. If BR is disable, squad will NOT be used at all.
#
# SquadScale - more players = more zeds in squad instead of them having more health. Number means number of players per
#   each zed to spawn and max health (in terms of "players") for each zed to have.
# Example:
# SpecialSquads=~6: BOSS
# ^ Spawns extra boss per each 6 players. Each boss won't have more than 6p hp.
# Total health of all bosses will match the player count:
# 1 player : 1 boss, 1p hp
# 2 players: 1 boss, 2p hp
# 6 players: 1 boss, 6p hp
# 7 players: 2 bosses, 3.5p hp each
# 8 players: 2 bosses, 4p hp each
# 9 players: 2 bosses, 4.5p hp each
# 10 players: 2 bosses, 5p hp each
# 11 players: 2 bosses, 5.5p hp each
# 12 players: 2 bosses, 6p hp each
# 13 players: 3 bosses, 4.33p hp each (13/3)
# 18 players: 3 bosses, 6p hp each
# 20 players: 4 bosses, 3.33p hp each
#
# *** RULES FOR SQUAD SPAWN ***
# If ANY zed alias in squad definition is disabled and no fallback given, then
#   squad will not be used at all!
# Squads and SpecialSquads are picked randomly from the list (unless bRandomSquads=false or bRandomSpecialSquads=false).
# Neither Squads nor SpecialSquads are not used twice unless there are no squads remaining.
# If all squads are used, then list gets regenerated and reshuffled.
# Duplicates are allowed. You can have multiple records of the same squad definition to
# raise percentage of specific zeds.
# There is a cooldown after each squad spawn. Therefore having a single squad "8*CL" makes
# zeds spawn twice faster than having 2 squads "4*CL" or 4 times faster than having 4 "2*CL".
# For sake of balance, you should put small zeds in larger squads (4-8 members) while keeping
# big/medium zeds is smaller ones (1-3 members) with an exception of SpecialSquads which are
# meant to do a heavy pressure.
#
# *** DIALOGUE DEFINITION *********************************************************************************************
# <Dialogues>=<Pause>
#   or:
# <Dialogues>=[?|^][<Duration>]:<Speaker>:<Message>
#   , where:
# Dialogues = TraderDialogues | CombatDialogues | FtgDialogues
# Pause - pause between dialogues in seconds
# ? - optional dialogue. If the dialogue cannot be displayed (e.g., the requested player is not found), continue with
#   the next one. If a non-optional dialogue cannot be display, the entire dialogue session ends.
# ^ - keep with next. Implies "?". If the previous dialogue was not displayed, don't display this one.
# Duration - time to display the dialogue in seconds. If not set, the game automatically calculates the duration based
#   on the Message length.
# Speaker = Trader | Player | Player<X> | Player-<X>
#       , where:
#       Trader - the Trader, obviously.
#       Player - a random alive player from the team.
#       Player<X>, where X = number, e.g., "Player3" - the specific player.
#           On the first call, a random player is picked and saved into the slot X.
#           If the alive player count is less than X, the dialogue fails (does not get displayed). If the dialogue is
#           not optional (?), the entire dialogue session ends.
#           On subsequent calls, the same player is taken from the slot X. If the player is dead, the dialogue fails.
#           If the player is disconnected, a new player is picked for the slot.
#       Player-<X>, where X = number, e.g., "Player-3" - pick a random player excluding the one in slot X.
# Message - the dialogue text.
#
# If all optional fields are omitted, the leading colon is still mandatory!
#   A WRONG LINE:     TraderDialogues=Trader:Message
#   A CORRECT LINE:   TraderDialogues=:Trader:Message
#
# *** THE "DIFFERENT PLAYERS FOR SUBSEQUENT LINES" RULE:
# The game always selects different players for two subsequent dialogues, where the speakers are randomly chosen ones.
# That prevents a situation where a player appears to be talking to themselves.
# If the above limitation is underired, and you want the same player to speak twice, use "Player1" instead.

# For example:
#   CombatDialogues=:Player:Hello, everybody!
#   CombatDialogues=:Player:Hey, there!
# A different player will be chosen for each of the two lines above.
# In a solo game, the second line will not be displayed, ending the combat dialogues.
# If you don't want both dialogues in a solo game, start with Player2:
#   CombatDialogues=:Player2:Hello, everybody!
#   CombatDialogues=:Player:Hey, there!
# Since the alive player count in a solo game is 1, the "Player2" selection fails, and nothing will be displayed.
# If you need to continue the dialogue after the greetings. make them optional:
#   CombatDialogues=?:Player2:Hello, everybody! This is an optional line.
#   CombatDialogues=^:Player:Hey, there! This line is displayed only together with the previous one.
#   CombatDialogues=:Trader:An important message that will always be displayed, even if the above lines fail.
#
# The "Different players for subsequent lines" rule is applied only for TWO subsequent lines.
# The third line can be assigned to the same player as the first one.
# To apply the rule to different lines, use the Player-X speaker, meaning anybody but X:
#   TraderDialogues=?:Player3:Knock, knock.
#   TraderDialogues=^:Player:Not the stupid knock-knock jokes again!
#   TraderDialogues=^:Player-3:Who's there?
#   TraderDialogues=^:Player3:It's Ahmed. Silence! I'll kill you!
# For the 3rd line, we use "Player-3" to exclude Player3 from the random selection. Additionally, the selected player
# will not bet the second line's speaker due to the "Different players for subsequent lines" rule.
# The 4th line will be repeated by the same player who spoke the first line.
# Since the above dialogue requires at least 3 players, we use Player3 (we could use Player4 or above, too).
#
# Note that the assigned players remain in their slots for the entire game, unless they disconnect.
