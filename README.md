# KF Scrn Balance

Total rebalance of the game. Added new guns, Gunslinger perk, and server-side achievements.

## Changelog

You can view complete changelog [here](Docs/CHANGELOG.md).

## Main Features

* Featuring [eXpert Challenge Mode (XCM)](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ScrNBalance/discussions/9/4580716151550023598/).
* Featuring [Social Isolation Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ScrNBalance/discussions/2/4666237625653274273/).
* New perks: **Gunslinger** and Combat **Medic**.
* Balances weapons and perks, making each perk useful in the game.
* Perk levels up to 70 but no grinding required! Perk *bonus* levels automatically adjust to the game difficulty and player count always to bring a balanced gameplay experience while allowing perk progression (making e-penis bigger).
* Perk bonuses for custom weapons (the ones you get from Workshop)
* New weapons: **Golden M79 Incendiary**, **Napalm Thrower**, **Laser Dual-MK23**, etc.
* Medic Grenade Launchers: **M79M Medic GL**, **M4-203M Medic Rifle**.
* **Tactical Reload** for Assault Rifles, Sniper Rifles, SMG, and pistols.
* **Quick Melee Bash**
* **Chainsaw** consumes fuel and brings real massacre to the game.
* Changing gun skins "on-the-fly", e.g., switch from the regular to golden AK-47 on a key press.
* **30 game modes** (some require [ScrN Brutal KF Bundle])
* Enhanced server-side zed hitboxes (less wonky headshots)
* More than **400 achievements**.

Most features are configurable (turn on only what you like).

## Optional Features

* Configurable spawn inventory and weapon prices.
* Cool HUD
* Manual Reloading
* Grenade "Cooking"
* Show Damage Numbers
* User-defined soundtrack.
* Voting to end trader time, boost zed spawn, etc.
* Configurable max zeds at once on the map. Now you can raise the previously hardcoded value of 32 zeds and fight against a 100-zed crowd!
